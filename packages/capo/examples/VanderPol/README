This integrator has been modified from main.cpp for the VanderPol 
ODE found in the integration 
program written by Blake Ashby at Stanford.  His files included here: 
decsol.cpp, decsol.h, IntegratorT.cpp, IntegratorT.h, 
StiffIntegratorT.cpp and  StiffIntegratorT.h.  The files were 
downloaded from http://www.unige.ch/math/folks/hairer/software.html
It is his C++ version of RADAU5 details of which are found in
Solving Ordinary Differential Equations. Stiff and 
Differential-Algebraic Problems. 2nd edition. Springer Series in 
Comput. Math., vol. 14.  The following Licence must accompany
