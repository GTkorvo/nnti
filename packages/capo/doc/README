Capo Documentation
-----------------

You may access/create the Capo documentation in three ways...

1. ONLINE DOCUMENTATION

   The documentation is online at http://software.sandia.gov/capo/.

2. MANUALLY GENERATE THE DOCUMENTATION

   Within the doc subdirectory, type

   > doxygen Doxyfile.default

   Then browse to doc/html/index.html to get started.

3. AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE THE DOCUMENTATION

   Let $CAPO_SRC denote the top level CAPO directory, and let $CAPO_BUILD
   denote the top level build directory (often these are the same). 

   Within the $CAPO_BUILD directory, type

   > configure [options]
   > make dox

   This will create the documentation inside the $NOX_SRC
   directory. Browse to $CAPO_SRC/doc/html/index.html.
