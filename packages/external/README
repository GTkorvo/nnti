The "external" Trilinos package makes it possible to easily add additional
packages that are external to Trilinos to the Trilinos build process.

To add a package with a top level directory called NEW (that has been properly
set up, more about this below) to the build process:

1. Put the code into a new directory Trilinos/packages/external/NEW. 

2. In Trilinos/packages/external, type ./CustomizeExternal.csh NEW

3. Build Trilinos in the usual way, adding any arguments necessary for NEW.

Note that NEW can be a single package or a multilevel configure structure 
like Trilinos.  If more than one package is to be added to the build process,
it is easiest to set up a Trilinos-like level.

The setup requirements for NEW are fairly minimal:

1. NEW must recognize the "configure" command in the same way that Trilinos
packages do.

It is suggested that packages also:

1. Use Autoconf and Automake.

2. Support the same basic set of options that Trilinos packages support.

3. Support the make install make target.

4. Utilize makefile.export - both reading from other packages and producing
a makefile.export.NEW file for other applications to use.  **If starting with
makefile.export files from a Trilinos package, keep in mind that the 
relative location of the top level Trilinos directory will be ../../../ 
instead of ../../.
