\section aristos_intro Introduction 
The Trilinos/packages/aristos package was created as a tool for developers
wishing to utilize the Autotools configure/build process for a new or existing
package.  Before beginning this process, approval must be obtained from the
Trilinos Project Leader.

See packages/aristos/README for more details

\section aristos_startup Overview of aristos

aristos contains two classes:

<ul> 

<li> Newp_Hello 
<li> Newp_Jambo (only if configured with --enable-newp_swahili)


</ul>

This documentations should not be taken as a guide.  I made it work
with doxygen and illustrated one or two features.  Nothing more.

\section aristos_browser Browse all of aristos as a single doxygen collection

You can browse all of Aristos as a <A HREF="../../browser/doc/html/index.html">single
doxygen collection</A>. Warning, this is not the recommended way to learn
about Aristos software.  However, this is a good way to browse the <a
href="../../browser/doc/html/dirs.html">directory structure of aristos</a>, to <a
href="../../browser/doc/html/files.html">locate files</a>, etc.
