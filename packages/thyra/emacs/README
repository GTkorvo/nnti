Here is a .emacs file and a syntax highlighting lisp file that Roscoe Bartlett
uses to to format C++ code in Thyra and related projects.  To setup your
system to use this .emacs file, from this directory, just run the script:

  ./setup-emacs-formating.sh

and it will copy the following files:

 $HOME
   |
   |-- .emacs
   |
   \-- elisp
         |
         \-- cpp-font-lock.el

Note that it will overwrite any $HOME/.emacs file that you might have so
please move it out of the way before you run this script.  Also, if you already
have a directory $HOME/elisp, you might want to take care of what happens here
too.
