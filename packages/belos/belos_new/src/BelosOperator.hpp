/*!	\class Belos::Operator

	\brief Belos's templated pure virtual class for constructing the operator that is
	used by the linear solver.  

	This operator is used as the interface to the matrix (<tt>A</tt>), 
	solution (<tt>X</tt>), and right-hand side (<tt>B</tt>) of the linear system <tt>AX = B</tt>.
	Furthermore, it is also the interface to left/right preconditioning and left/right scaling of the
	linear system.

	A concrete implementation of this class is necessary.  The user can create their own implementation
	if those supplied are not suitable for their needs.
