TOPICS FOR THE CODE REVIEW BEGINNING MAY 19, 2003

Termination Criterion:
----------------------
Should we remove the '..._with_int' and '..._with_double' from
the functions that add criteria to the objects.

Add multiple norms to measure the gradients.


MsqMeshEntity
-------------
why do we have get_vertex_index_array() and get_vertex_indices(). 
Are they both efficient ? Can we remove the inefficient one.


General code
------------
Scaling issues 

Condition Nb / Mean ratio
-------------------------
Make sure they call the same functions in 2D.
