This file explains how to build the Mesquite library
(mesquite.a) from source code.

1) cd to the src/ directory.

2) While in the src/ directory, type 'config'.  This
   will set up the makefiles with a default configuration
   for your platform.

3) Examine the file src/Makefile.customize.  This file
   defines the tools and settings to be used while
   compiling Mesquite.  Make any modifications you
   deem necessary.  A description of each of the
   makefile variables is included at the end of this file
   (or at least there will be - haven't done it yet).

4) While in the src/ directory, type 'make'.  This will
   compile all source files and create mesquite.a.  If
   the build is not successful, you may need to make
   additional modifications to Makefile.customize.
