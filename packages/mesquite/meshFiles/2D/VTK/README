List of two-dimensional meshes.

equil_tri2.vtk:  10 triangles in the z=0 plane.  When optimized the
  elements are equilateral.  Two free vertices.

four_more_quad.vtk:

half_circ.vtk:  640 quad elements; planer mesh; (z=-5 plane)  Mesh is
  on a half-circle geometry, and contains two 3-val vertices.

Mesquite_geo_10242:  20480 triangular elements (10242 vertices) on a
  unit sphere geometry.  Fixed vertices are the twelve 5 valence vertices.
  All are vertices are 6 valence.

overt_hyb_1.vtk:  Hybrid mesh provided by Overture.

overt_hyb_2.vtk:  Hybrid mesh provided by Overture.

quad_2_not_xy.vtk:  Quad mesh with one free vertex; 4 quad elements;
  planer, but not in the xy plane.

quads_4by2.vtk:  Quad mesh with ideal square elements.  8 quad
  elements with 3 free vertices.

quad_4by2_bad.vtk:  Same as quads_4by2.vtk except the free vertices
  have been perturbed away from the ideal positions.

square_quad_10_rand.vtk:  A ten-by-ten grid of quad elements, with
  the free vertices randomly perturbed. (z = 5 plane)

square_quad_2.vtk:  A two-by-two grid of quad elements with the
  free vertex randomly perturbed.  (z = 5 plane)

square_tri_2.vtk:  Triangular mesh (z=5 plane) on a square.  One free vertex.

tangled_tri.vtk:  58 triangles in the z=5 plane on a square.  Contains
  inverted elements.

tangled_quad.vtk:  25 quads in the z=5 plane on a square.  Contains
  inverted elements.

tri_20258.vtk:  Triangular mesh with 20258 elements on a square
  (z=5 plane).

tri_5_not_xy.vtk:  Triangular mesh with 50 elements on a square.
  Not in the xy plane.
