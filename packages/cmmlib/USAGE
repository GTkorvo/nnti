The library depends on BLAS and MPI, although it
may be compiled without either. See README
for details.

The library can be used in dependent projects.
Include the cmmlib.mk file in your
Makefile. Then the parameters CMMLIB_INCLUDE
and CMMLIB_LIB are defined. Add $(CMMLIB_INCLUDE)
to your CFLAGS or CXXFLAGS, and include "cmm.h"
in your source code. Add $(CMMLIB_LIBS) and
also $(BLAS_LIBS) (and possibly $(FLIBS)) to
your link command.
