  To build and install CMMLIB:

   0) download and unpack the tar.gz file. You have already done this
    or you would not be reading this file.

   1) configure

    The configure script itself and supporting stuff is in the config.dir
    directory.  CMMLIB depends on the usual C compilers and libraries. It also
    depends on BLAS and MPI. These are difficult to configure automatically,
    so there are a number of scripts in config.dir that will run configure with
    parameters set for various systems.
 
    So, execute

      cd config.dir
      ./configure

    with options, or modify and run one of the scripts. The most obvious
    thing to modify is the --prefix=... location, which defines where
    everything is installed.

    You can also just execute (in the top directory of the package)

      make configure

    if you feel lucky.

   2) compile

   After the package is configured, compilation is done with

      make all

   in the top directory of the package.

   3) install

   After the package is compiled, it is installed with

      make install

   Note that the --prefix=... parameter in the configuration step
   determines where the installation will go.

   The package will install the library in the ${prefix}/lib directory
   and will install a directory cmmlib in the ${prefix}/include directory.
   The include directory will contain various .h files and a Makefile
   fragment cmmlib.mk, which can be included by dependent project
   make files. This fragment defines among other things the following
   variables:

      CMMLIB_INCLUDE
      CMMLIB_LIBS
      MPI_INCLUDE
      MPI_LIBS
      BLAS_INCLUDE
      BLAS_LIBS

   At the current time the package only installs a statically linked
   library (.a file).

   The package also installs a documentation directory ${prefix}/doc/cmmlib
   and the html documentation is installed there.

    4) uninstall

      make uninstall

   will remove installed files.
