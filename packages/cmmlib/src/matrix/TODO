Done:

  cholesky
  triangular solves
  eigen

  simple performance and accuracy testers for above

To do:

  qr
   also qr_apply

  geigen

Clean up code and documentation, add additional
documentation.

Add careful testing of eigensolver.

Add careful handling of degenerate eigenvalues.

r8 versions

Add code for band matrices? Right now I am not
really exporting what I have.

  -- at least QR and linear solvers.
