Dense matrix multiply and other simple linear algebra functions are covered
under the blas directory. The matrix directory covers more interesting
dense matrix operations:

  cholesky factorization
  triangle solves
  qr factorization
  lu decomposition
  lu back solve
  ordinary symmetric/hermitian eigensolve
  generalized symmetric/hermitian eigensolve
  nonsymmetric eigensolve
  singular value decomposition

(what about orthogonalization?, triangular multiplies?, determinant/inverse?
  matrix exponential, matrix sign, ...)

Mostly I will provide blocked and unblocked routines. The blocked
routine is the general interface and will call the unblocked routine
for smaller matrices.
