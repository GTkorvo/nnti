  Why put configure in the config.dir directory?

  Quite frankly, autoconf and configure are messy. This
  allows a much cleaner look to the top level directory.

  My approach is to have configure create a small number
  of files that all the remaining Makefiles etc can
  include.

  Other things (like config.dox) can also be put here.
