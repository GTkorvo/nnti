In transitioning from shards array to Kokkos:

1. Add fused kernel loop support to phalanx (currently kernel launch loops need be run individually in each evaluator.
2. [DONE] Remove the algebraic types and corresponding tests form example/Energy_Flux and from test/Utilties.
3. [DONE] Remove all uses of the Allocator.  At one point this was going to move into Teuchos.  Not sure if it is still needed.
4. [DONE] Remove the dependence on shards array.  We leveraged the tag types from shards.  Should probably copy that into phalanx now and drop shards altogether.
5. [DONE] Port all tests examples to GPU and make sure they run.  So far all tests and the MultidiensionalArray example work on all types of devices (OpenMP, Seial and CUDA) nodes.
6. [DONE] Remove the PHX::TypeStrings.  Need to make sure demangling works on all compilers.  Or alternatively, implement the default with teuchos demangling and still allow codes to override with specializations (This is better).
7. Documentation and users guide is completely out of date with change to kokkos.  Need to refactor.
8. [DONE] Add const protection to dependent fields vs evaluated fields.
9. [DONE] Change over all unit tests to use the teuchos test harness.
10. [DONE] Remove the Phalanx_ConfigDefs.hpp file.  It is now obsolete - you should just include the autogenerated Phalanx_config.hpp.
11. Copy the cmake support in stokhos for generating .cu file for cuda kernels.
12. Update evaluators in test/Utilities for const protection.  We are currently leaving them non-const to protect deprecated non-const dependent field code in testing.  The examples all use the updated const protected versions.
13. Add support for extra string names in data layouts.  Sometimes the rank tags are insufficient to distiguish between layouts and we don't want to directly augment field names.
