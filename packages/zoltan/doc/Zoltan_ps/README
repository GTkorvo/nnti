The Zoltan documentation is written in HTML.
If you want to print a hardcopy of e.g. the
User's Guide, this may be difficult to do from
a web browser because the User's Guide consists
of many HTML files. A better alternative is to convert
the HTML files to PostScript. The Makefile in this directory
attempts to create a single ps file out of many HTML files
using the html2ps script. The paths are specific to
SNL Bldg 980, so you have to edit the Makefile to
make it consistent with your system.

html2ps is available from http://www.tdb.uu.se/~jan/html2ps.html
It is a fairly simple yet powerful converter, but you
may choose to use a different conversion program.
