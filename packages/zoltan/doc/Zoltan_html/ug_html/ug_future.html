<h2>
<a NAME="Future Work"></a>Future Work</h2>
Future efforts will focus on testing the interface in a variety of applications
and developing new algorithms for the load- balancing library. Preliminary
tests of the interface in an unstructured finite element method have been
successful. The load-balancing query functions can be implemented with
a small amount of C code (less than 200 lines), and data migration can
be accomplished without additional communication code in the application
using a calling sequence similar to that in the <a href="ug_examples_mig.html#User-guided Migration Example">user-guided
migration example</a>.
<p>Algorithmic development will focus first on the development of a model
for heterogeneous computing systems. Processor speeds, processor memory
sizes, and interconnection network speeds will be included in the model.
The model will be tested first in the <a href="ug_alg.html">algorithms</a>
already implemented. New algorithmic development will be required to use
the heterogeneous system model.
<p>In static partitioning, comparisons of algorithms are performed based
on their execution times and quality of partition.&nbsp; Comparisons of
dynamic load-balancing algorithms, however, must also account for the data
migration costs of a new partition.&nbsp; Using Zoltan, we will investigate
the relative importance of partition quality, time to compute new partitions
and data migration costs in a number of applications.&nbsp; For some applications,
lower-quality partitions may be acceptable is data migration costs can
be minimized.&nbsp; Other applications may perform better with high-quality
partitions, regardless of the cost of obtaining them.&nbsp; Zoltan's design
enables such comparisons.&nbsp; Since it includes a suite of methods, many
different methods can be tried in a single application.&nbsp; And because
it is easy to incorporate Zoltan in new applications, load-balancing algorithms'
performance can be analyzed in different types of simulations.
