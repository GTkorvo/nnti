Future efforts will focus on testing the interface in a variety of applications
and developing new algorithms for the load- balancing library. Preliminary
tests of the interface in an unstructured finite element method have been
successful. The load-balancing query functions can be implemented with
a small amount of C code (less than 200 lines), and data migration can
be accomplished without additional communication code in the application
using a calling sequence similar to that in the <A HREF="ug_examples_mig.html#User-guided Migration Example">user-guided
migration example</A>.

<P>Algorithmic development will focus first on the development of a model
for heterogeneous computing systems. Processor speeds, processor memory
sizes, and interconnection network speeds will be included in the model.
The model will be tested first in the simple <A HREF="ug_alg.html">algorithms</A>
already implemented. New algorithmic development will be required to use
the heterogeneous system model.

<P>After heterogeneous computing model is developed, new algorithms will
be implemented. These algorithms will include local diffusion algorithms
that test the graph-based interface to the load-balancing library and tree-based
algorithms that can take advantage of information available in tree-based
applications such as finite element methods with adaptive mesh refinement.
The tree-based algorithms will require additions to the load-balancing
interface, but the existing interface routines should remain unchanged.
