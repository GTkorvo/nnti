<H3>
Existing implementations</H3>
The main Makefile has not yet been updated to include the Fortran option
in the process of building the Zoltan library. So far, the Fortran interface
has been built and tested only through <I>fdriver</I>, and only on NIST
machines. This section will be written after the Makefile has been updated.
The main issues to be discussed will be using <B>YES_FORTRAN=1</B> in the
make command, and mention of<I> lb_user_const*.h</I> with a pointer to
the section below. There will be some other parameters (selection of which
Fortran compiler on Linux, and selection between LAM and MPICH), but these
will probably affect only the NIST builds so I'm not sure they're worth
mentioning.
<H3>
Porting to a new system</H3>
There are some issues here that I probably should explain.
