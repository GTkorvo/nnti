\chapter{Introduction}

This document provides a brief introduction to the Zoltan Toolkit,
for Zoltan version 2.1.  Zoltan is a parallel load balancing library
targeted to the high performance computing community.  It can be
linked with C, C++ and Fortran applications, but this tutorial
will provide most of its examples in C.

The first section will discuss the load balancing problem in general,
the multitude of solutions that Zoltan offers, and will provide a guide
to choosing the method or methods best suited to your problem.

The next section will describe in more detail the load balancing
methods introduced in the first section. 

Finally we list the full source code for some simple C and C++
examples.   These code examples are also in the \textbf{examples} directory
of the Zoltan source code.  You can obtain the source code,
along with installation instructions at
\url{http://www.cs.sandia.gov/Zoltan/}.

A more detailed and complete explanation of the application
programmer's interface to Zoltan may be found 
in the Zoltan User's Guide at
\url{http://www.cs.sandia.gov/Zoltan/ug_html/ug.html}.

% Should we have a pointer to a list of publications as well.
