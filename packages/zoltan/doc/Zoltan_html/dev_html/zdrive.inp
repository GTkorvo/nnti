# GENERAL NOTES
#
# 1) Any line beginning with a "#" is considered a comment and will be
# ignored by the file parser.
#
# 2) The order of the lines IS NOT significant.
#
# 3) Any lines that are optional are marked as such in this file. Unless
# otherwise noted a line is required to exist in any input file.
#
# 4) The case of words IS NOT significant, e.g., "file" IS equivalent
# to "FILE" or "File", etc.
#
# 5) The amount of blank space in between words is also significant. Each
# word should only be separated by a single space.
#
# 6) Blank lines are ignored.

# Decomposition Info = <options>
#
# This line is used to specify the algorithm that Zoltan will use
# and what tolerance it will attempt to maintain. The options for
# this line are:
#	method=<method>	Use this option to specify the method that Zoltan
#			will use to do the load balance. Currently, the
#			only methods that are acceptable are:
#				rcb - Reverse Coordinate Bisection
#				octpart - Octree/Space Filling Curve
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Decomposition Info	= method=rcb

#+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# Zoltan Parameters = <options>
#
# This line is OPTIONAL. If it is not included, no user-defined parameters
# will be passed to Zoltan.
#
# This line is used to to specify parameter values to overwrite the default
# parameter values used in Zoltan.  These parameters will be passed to Zoltan
# through calls to LB_Set_Param(). Parameters are set by entries consisting
# of pairs of strings "<parameter string>=<value string>". 
# The <parameter string> should be a string that is recognized by the
# particular load-balancing method being used.
# The parameter entries should be separated by commas. 
# When many parameters must be specified, multiple
# "Zoltan Parameters" lines may be included in the input file.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Zoltan Parameters	= RCB_WGTFLAG=0,RCB_OVERALLOC=1.0

# File Type = <file type><,chaco options>
#
# This line is OPTIONAL. If it is not included, then it is assumed that
# the file type is parallel nemesis.
#
# This line contains tells which format the file is in. The current
# file types for this line are:
#	NemesisI	- parallel ExodusII/NemesisI files (1 per processor)
#	Chaco		- Chaco graph and/or geometry file(s)
#
# For NemesisI input, the initial distribution of data is given in the 
# Nemesis files.  For Chaco input, however, an initial decomposition is
# imposed by the zdrive.  Two initial distribution methods are provided.
# The method to be used can be specified in the chaco options:
#       initial distribution = <option>
# where <option> is
#       linear  -- gives the first n/p vertices to proc 0, the
#                  next n/p vertices to proc 1, etc.  
#       cyclic  -- assigns the vertices to processors as one would
#                  deal cards; i.e., gives the first vertex to proc 0, 
#                  the second vertex to proc 1, ..., the pth vertex to 
#                  proc (p-1),the (p+1)th vertex to proc 0, the (p+2)th 
#                  vertex to proc 1, etc.
# If an initial distribution is not specified, the default is linear.
# For example,
#       File Type = chaco, initial distribution = cyclic
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
File Type		= NemesisI

#+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# File Name = <filename>
#
# This line contains the filename for the input finite element mesh.
#
# If the file type is NemesisI then this name refers to the base name
# of the parallel ExodusII files that contain the results. The base
# name is the parallel filename without the trailing .<# proc>.<file #>
# on it. This file must contain the Nemesis global information.
#
# If the file type is Chaco, this name refers to the base name of the
# Chaco files containing graph and/or coordinates information.  The
# file <filename>.graph will be read for the Chaco graph information;
# The file <filename>.coords will be read for Chaco geometry information.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
File Name	= testa.par

# Parallel Disk Info = <options>
#
# This line is OPTIONAL. If this line is left blank, then it is assumed
# that there is no parallel disk information, and all of the files are
# in a single directory.  This line is used only for Nemesis files.
#
# This line gives all of the information about the parallel file system
# being used. There are a number of options that can be used with it,
# although for most cases only a couple will be needed. The options are:
#
#       number=<integer> - this is the number of parallel disks that the
#                          results files are spread over. This number must
#                          be specified, and must be first in the options
#                          list. If zero (0) is specified, then all of the
#                          files should be in the root directory specified
#                          below.
#       list={list}      - OPTIONAL, If the disks are not sequential, then a
#                          list of disk numbers can be given. This list should
#                          be enclosed in brackets "{}", and the disk numbers
#                          can be seperated by any of the following comma,
#                          blank space, tab, or semicolon.
#       offset=<integer> - OPTIONAL, This is the offset from zero that the
#                          disk numbers begin with. If no number is specified,
#                          this defaults to 1. This option is ignored if
#                          "list" is specified.
#       zeros            - OPTIONAL, This specifies that leading zeros are
#                          used in the parallel file naming convention. For
#                          example, on the Paragon, the file name for the
#                          first pfs disk is "/pfs/tmp/io_01/". If this is
#                          specified, then the default is not to have leading
#                          zeros in the path name, such as on the teraflop
#                          machine "/pfs/tmp_1/".

Parallel Disk Info	= number=4,zeros

#+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# Parallel file location = <options>
#
# This line is OPTIONAL, only if the above line is excluded as well, or
# the number of raids is specified as zero (0). If this line is excluded,
# then the root directory is set to the execution directory, ".", and all
# files should be in that directory.  This line is used only for Nemesis 
# files.
#
# This line gives all of the information about where the parallel files are
# located. There are only two options for this line, and both must be
# specified. The options are:
#       root=<root directory name>
#         This line is used to specify what the name of the root directory is
#         on the target machine. This can be any valid root directory
#         name. For example, if one is running on an SGI workstation and
#         using the "tflop" numbering scheme then you could use something
#         similar to "/usr/tmp/pio_" in this field so that files would be
#         written to root directories named:
#               /usr/tmp/pio_1
#               /usr/tmp/pio_2
#                       .
#                       .
#                       .
#               /usr/tmp/pio_<Parallel Disk Info, number>
#
#       subdir=<subdirectory name>
#         This line specifies the name of the subdirectory, under the root
#         directory, where files are to be written. This is tacked onto
#         the end of the "root" after an appropriate integer is added to
#         "root". Continuing with the example given for "root", if "subdir"
#         had a value of "run1/input" files would be written to directories
#         named:
#               /usr/tmp/pio_1/run1/input/
#               /usr/tmp/pio_1/run1/input/
#                       .
#                       .
#                       .
#               /usr/tmp/pio_<Parallel Disk Info, number>/run1/input/

# Zdrive debug level = <integer>
#
# This line is optional.  It sets a debug level within zdrive (not within
# Zoltan) that determines what output is written to stdout at runtime.
# The currently defined values are listed below.  For a given debug level
# value i, all debug output for levels <= i is printed.
#
# 	0   --  No debug output is produced.
#	1   --  Evaluation of the initial and final partition is done
#               through calls to driver_eval and LB_Eval.
#	2   --  Function call traces through major driver functions are
#               printed.
#       3   --  Not used yet.
#       4   --  Entire distributed mesh (elements, adjacencies, communication
#               maps, etc.) is printed.  This output is done serially and can
#               be big and slow.
#
# Default value is 1.

Zdrive debug level = 1
