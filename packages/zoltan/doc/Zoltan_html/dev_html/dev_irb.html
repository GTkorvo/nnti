<A NAME="IRB"></A>Appendix: Inertial Recursive Bisection (IRB)</H2>
&nbsp;

<H3>
Outline of Algorithm</H3>

<P>The implementation of Inertial Recursive Bisection (IRB) in Zoltan is due
due to Bruce Hendrickson and Robert Leland of Sandia National Laboratories for
use in <a href="http://www.cs.sandia.gov/CRF/chac.html">Chaco</a> 
and was modified by Courtenay Vaughan.  IRB is an algorithm
similar to RCB (see the <B><A HREF="dev_rcb.html">appendix on RCB</A></B> for
a discription of RCB) in that it uses the coordinates of the objects to be
balanced to do the load balancing.  Similarly to RCB, the domain is
recursively divided into two pieces until the number of subdomains needed is
reached.  In each stage of the division, the direction of the principle axis
of the domain to be divided is calculated by determining an eigenvector of
the inertial matrix.  This direction vector is used to define a normal to a
plane which is used to divide the domain into two pieces.  This process is
repeated until the desired number of subdomains is reached.

<P>The communication of objects being divided is handled by the same routine
as is used by <B><A HREF="dev_rcb.html">RCB</A></B>.  For applications which
wish to add more objects to the decomposition at a later time, information to
do this can be retained during the decomposition phase.  This information is
kept if the parameter IRB_KEEP_CUTS is set during the decomposition (see the
IRB section in the <B><A HREF="../ug_html/ug_alg_irb.html">Zoltan User's
Guide</A></B>).  The process is similar to that used for RCB, but the
information being kept is different.  For each IRB cut, the center of mass
of the subdomain which is being cut, the direction vector, and a distance from
the center of mass to the cutting plane have to be saved.

<BR>&nbsp;

<H3>
Data Structure Definitions</H3>

<P>There are three major data structures in IRB and they are defined in
irb_const.h.  The points which are being load balanced are represented as a
structure irb_dot which contains the location of the point, its weight, and
a tag to identify the point.  The nodes on the decomposition tree are
represented by the structure irb_tree which contains the position of the cut,
the center of mass of the subdomain which is being cut, the direction vector
of the principle axis of the subdomain, and the node's parent and two
children (if they exist) in the tree.  The structure IRB_Struct is the IRB data
structure which holds pointers to all of the other data structures needed for
IRB.  It contains an array of irb_dot to represent the points being load
balanced, array of irb_tree (whose length is the number of processors) which
contains the decomposition tree, and the dimension of the problem.

<BR>&nbsp;

<H3>
Parameters</H3>

<P>The parameters used by IRB and their default values are described in the
IRB section of the <B><A HREF="../ug_html/ug_alg_irb.html">Zoltan User's
Guide</A></B>.  These can be set by use of the LB_Set_IRB_Param subroutine
in the file rcb.c.
 
<BR>&nbsp;

<H3>
Main Routine</H3>

<P>The main routine for IRB is LB_irb in the file irb.c.
