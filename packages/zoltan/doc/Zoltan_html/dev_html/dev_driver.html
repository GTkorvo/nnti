<A NAME="Zdrive"></A>Appendix: Using the Test Driver - <I>zdrive</I></H2>

<H3>
<A NAME="Introduction"></A>Introduction</H3>
In order to facilitate development and testing of the Zoltan library, a
simple driver program, <I>zdrive</I>,&nbsp; is included with the library
distribution. The concept behind this driver is to read in mesh or graph
information from files, run Zoltan, and then output the new assignments
for each processor to another file. The test driver reads ExodusII/NemesisI
parallel FEM files and Chaco input files. Parallel NemesisI files can be
created from ExodusII or Genesis file using the NemesisI utilities <I>nem_slice</I>
and <I>nem_spread</I>.

<P>All source code for the driver is in the <I>driver/</I> directory of
the DLB distribution. In order to compile the test driver for a specific
platform, use the following command:
<UL>gmake [options] &lt;platform>-dr</UL>
where &lt;platform> is the target OS platform and the options are described
below. Currently, the supported platforms are <I>sun</I> (for Solaris)<I>,
sunos</I> (for SunOS<I>), tflop, cplant, </I>and <I>smos</I>. The driver
<I>zdrive</I> will be placed in the Obj_&lt;platform>/ directory.
<H3>
<A NAME="running zdrive"></A>Running <I>zdrive</I></H3>
Zdrive is run using an input command file. A fully commented example of
this file and the possible options can be found here, <I><A HREF="zdrive.inp">zdrive.inp</A></I>.
Zdrive.inp is the default name for this command file, and the driver will
look for this file in the execution directory if an alternate name is not
given on the command line. If another filename is being used for the command
file, then it should be specified as the first argument on the command
line. For an example of a simple input file for a problem on the Intel
Paragon sipapu, see the <A HREF="#zdrive input">figure</A> below. In this
problem, there are four parallel mesh files named <I>testa.par.4.0</I>...
<I>testa.par.4.3</I>, and they reside in the directories <I>pfs/io_01...
io_04/mmstjohn/</I> respectively. The method being used for dynamic load
balancing is <A HREF="dev_rcb.html#RCB">RCB</A>. All of the parameters
are set to defaults by Zoltan since none are set in the input file.

&nbsp;
<BR>After running zdrive, an ascii file named <I>testa.par.out.4.0... testa.par.out.4.3
</I>will be created for each processor in the same directory where the
input FEM file was located for that processor. Each file will contain a
list of global ids for the elements that are on that processor after running
Zoltan.
<H3>
&nbsp;<A NAME="adding algorithms"></A>Adding New Algorithms</H3>
The driver has been set up in such a way that testing new algorithms that
have been added to Zoltan is relatively simple. The method that is in the
input file is passed directly to Zoltan. So, this string must be the same
string that the library function <A HREF="../ug_html/ug_interface_lb.html#LB_Set_Method">LB_Set_Method
</A>is expecting.
