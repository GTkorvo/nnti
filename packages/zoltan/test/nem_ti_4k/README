Instructions for Nemesis examples

To change number of processors:
  1.  In problem subdirectory, change nem_slice_command file to include 
      mesh dimensions for desired number of processors (e.g., mesh=3x3 
      yields 9 processors).
  2.  Run nem_slice_command; a Nemesis decomposition file is produced
      (*.nemI).
  3.  Change LB file line in nem_spread.inp to be the Nemesis decomposition
      file produced in step 2.
  4.  Run nem_spread.  The parallel Nemesis files will be produced in
      ti_0* directories.
  5.  In zdrive.inp, change File Name to the base name for the files produced
      in step 4.

nem_ti_4k
  3D Tilted Reactor mesh with approx. 4k elements.
  Run on 9 processors (for committed values).
  Random Chaco decomposition initially.
  No vertex weighting.

Using ParMETIS2,
Answers on tflop, dec, and linux differ from answers on Sun for 
zdrive.inp.partgeom: (Tflop, dec and linux answers agree.)
   ElementID      SUN Assignment       Tflop/Dec Assignment
    2277                4                     3
    2758                3                     2
    3040                2                     4
Reason unknown.  

Using ParMETIS3, differences do not appear on dec, but still appear for tflop.

Answers differ for ParMETIS tests on linux platforms 
Suspect difference in rand() is the cause.
On linux, rand() returns values in the range 0 to 2147483647; on
Solaris, it returns values in the range 0 to 32767.  (See definition of
RAND_MAX in <stdlib.h>.)
