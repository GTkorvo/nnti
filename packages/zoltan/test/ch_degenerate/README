ch_degenerate
  Simple 3D geometries with degeneracies.

  Graph and coordinates included.  The graph files for the box, slab
    and shaft are identical.

  No vertex weights.

  "slab" - 1000 vertices equally spaced in [0,9]x[0,900]x[0,450].  When
    SKIP_DIMENSIONS is ON, this should be treated as a 2D object.

  "rotated_slab" - This is the slab rotated off of the coordinate axes.

  "shaft" - 1000 vertices equally spaced in [0,9]x[0,900]x[0,900].  When
    SKIP_DIMENSIONS is ON, this should be treated as a 1D object.

  "rotated_shaft" - This is the shaft rotated off of the coordinate axes.

  "box" - 1000 vertices equally spaced in [0,9]x[0,9]x[0,9].  When
    SKIP_DIMENSIONS is ON, no special action should be taken.

  "rotated_box" - This is the box rotated off of the coordinate axes.

Note that when the axis-aligned shaft is partitioned using hsfc, you may 
get a warning that Zoltan could not achieve the desired level of balancing.  
This is because the transformed shaft points line up along 10 points of the
X-axis, with 100 points in the original shaft projecting to each of the
10 points on the X-axis.  A 1-dimensional HSFC is then performed.  HSFC
will not split up the points that project to the same point, so if the 
number of processes does not evenly divide 10, there will be a large imbalance.
