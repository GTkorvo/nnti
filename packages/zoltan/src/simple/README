This module (directory) contains a couple very simple partitioning
algorithms. They are instructional and useful mainly for testing,
not for real work.

random - Randomly assigns objects, without attempting load-balance.
         May also be used to introduce random perturbations.

simple - A very simple load-balancing method based on "linear"
         partitioning.
