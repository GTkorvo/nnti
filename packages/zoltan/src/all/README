ALL DIRECTORY -- Routines for memory allocation and deallocation.
----------------------------------------------------------------

Files compiled into Zoltan:

all_allo_const.h   -- Prototypes for memory allocation and deallocation
                      routines in all_allo.c.  Definition of LB_MALLOC.

all_allo.c         -- Memory allocation routines LB_array_alloc and LB_malloc.
                      Memory deallocation routine LB_free.
		      Parameter setting routing LB_Set_Malloc_Param.

Files NOT compiled into Zoltan:

all_const.h        -- Type definitions for data structures and prototypes for 
                      external functions in the gr, vx, and id directories.
                      Only partially developed (and probably no longer needed).
                   
all_main.c         -- Main program for calling routines in ch directory
                      to read Chaco input files and build graphs for use by
                      the library.  Works with files in the gr directory.
