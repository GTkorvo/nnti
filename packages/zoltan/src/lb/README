LB DIRECTORY -- Zoltan query interface and application-callable routines.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Zoltan Interface Files -- routines intended to be called by the 
application should be put in these files.

lbi_const.h      -- Application-visible file with typedefs for query functions
                    and prototypes for application-callable library functions.
                    Also #include lb_user_const.h.
                    This file should be #included in application files that
                    call the load-balancing library.

lb_user_const.h  -- Application-defined data types and manipulation macros
                    for LB_GID and LB_LID.  This file is meant to be editted
                    by the application developer to define data types for
                    global and local object IDs.

lb_balance.c     -- Routines for computing new partitions and 
                    managing memory for allocated by Zoltan but returned
                    to the application. (LB_Balance, LB_Free_Data)

lb_eval.c        -- Routines for evaluating the quality of partitions.
                    (LB_Eval)

lb_init.c        -- Routines to initialize Zoltan. (LB_Initialize)

lb_migrate.c     -- Routines to provide help for data migration.
                    (LB_Compute_Destinations, LB_Help_Migrate)

lb_set_method.c  -- Routines to set the load-balancing method.
                    (LB_Set_Method)

lb_set_fn.c      -- Routines to register callback functions.
                    (LB_Set_Fn and variants for each specific type of
                    callback function.)

lb_struct.c      -- Routines that manage memory for load-balancing
                    structures.  (LB_Create and LB_Destroy)


END of Zoltan Interface Files.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Non-Interface routines may be put in the following files.

lb_const.h       -- Load-balancing data structures that are private to the 
                    library (i.e., not seen by the application).  Includes
                    definitions of LB_Struct, LB_Tag_Struct, LB_Migrate_Struct,
                    and LB_FN.
                    Includes enumerated type LB_Method for methods included
                    in the load-balancing library.
                    Also includes macros and prototypes for load-balancing 
                    functions.
                    This file should be included in most load-balancing files
                    since it includes the major data structure definitions.
                    It #includes lbi_const.h.

lb_util_const.h  -- Prototypes for external functions in lb_util.c.

lb_util.c        -- Contains code for non-algorithmic routines that are 
                    not application-callable but are called by the 
                    load-balancing library.  These routines are "service"
                    routines to the general library framework.
                    Currently, the only routine here is perform_error_checking.
