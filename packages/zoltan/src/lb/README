LB DIRECTORY -- Zoltan query interface and application-callable routines.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

lbi_const.h      -- Application-visible file with typedefs for query functions
                    and prototypes for application-callable library functions.
                    Also #include lb_user_const.h.
                    This file should be #included in application files that
                    call the load-balancing library.

lb_const.h       -- Load-balancing data structures that are private to the 
                    library (i.e., not seen by the application).  Includes
                    definitions of LB_Struct, LB_Tag_Struct, LB_Migrate_Struct,
                    and LB_FN.
                    Includes enumerated type LB_Method for methods included
                    in the load-balancing library.
                    Also includes macros and prototypes for load-balancing 
                    functions.
                    This file should be included in most load-balancing files
                    since it includes the major data structure definitions.
                    It #includes lbi_const.h.

lb_user_const.h  -- Application-defined data types and manipulation macros
                    for LB_GID and LB_LID.  This file is meant to be editted
                    by the application developer to define data types for
                    global and local object IDs.

lb_util_const.h  -- Prototypes for external functions in lb_util.c.


lb.c             -- Contains code for all application-callable library
                    functions.  Routines that are not to be called by the
                    application are not included in this file.

lb_util.c        -- Contains code for non-algorithmic routines that are 
                    not application-callable but are called by the 
                    load-balancing library.  These routines are "service"
                    routines to the general library framework.
                    Currently, the only routine here is perform_error_checking.
