How are sparse matrices represented? 

     Dense matrices are almost always represented as two dimensional arrays
(though not necessarily, there's some interesting
work on recursive data structures for arrays). Sparse matrices, on the
other hand, can be represented in a number of ways. 

     For this assignment, we'll assume the matrices come in column compressed
format. This means the matrices are stored in
column major order, and in particular they're stored in three arrays as
follows (assume 0 based indexing): 

         (nzval) The first array is an array of doubles, where each element is
         the value of a nonzero element (all elements in
         column 0 come before all elements in column 1 and so on). There are
         nnz elements in the array (nnz = number of nonzeros). 

         (rowind) The second array is an array of ints, also of length nnz.
         Each element contains the row index of the
         corresponding entry in the first array. 

         (colptr) The third array is an array of ints, with length n+1.
         Element i contains a pointer to the start of column i in the
         first two arrays. Element n contains the number of nonzeros in the
         matrix. 

     So, if the matrix is the following 3x3 matrix, 

             | 1 3  |
             |   4 5|
             | 2   6|
         

     the column compressed representation would be the following: 

             nzval  = [1 2 3 4 5 6]
             rowind = [0 2 0 1 1 2]
             colptr = [0 2 4 6]
