QUICK INSTALLATION

In order to build Zoltan, you must do the following steps:

1) Go to Utilities/Config and find a configuration file Config.<platform>
   that is similar to your platform, for example, gcc, solaris, dec, or tflop.
   Edit the paths as appropriate for your system. Use Config.generic if you 
   can't find anything better. 

2) Go back to the Zoltan root directory and type

      gmake ZOLTAN_ARCH=<platform> zoltan

   where <platform> is your platform. You may simply type "gmake zoltan" 
   if you are using the generic platform.

3) The Zoltan library is now located in Zoltan/Obj_<platform> as libzoltan.a.
   You will also need the libraries libzoltan_comm.a and libzoltan_mem.a.

It is strongly recommended that you read the more detailed installation 
instructions in the Zoltan User's Guide, which can be found at
Zoltan/docs/Zoltan_html/ug_html/ug.html (HTML) or at
Zoltan/docs/Zoltan_pdf/ug.pdf (pdf).

                   load-balancing data structure definitions, interface
                   functions, and functions related to the load-balancing
                   interface and migration-help tools.

fort            -- William Mitchell's Fortran interface for Zoltan.

ha 		-- Support for heterogeneous architectures (under development).

oct             -- RPI's octree partitioning and space-filling curves 
                   algorithms.

OTHER CODE (not compiled into the Zoltan library)
-------------------------------------------------

driver          -- Driver program zdrive that reads exodus/nemesis files, runs
                   Zoltan and then writes out the new assignment vectors.
                   This program is compiled by making the zdrive target.

ch              -- Routines developed by Hendrickson and Leland to read Chaco
                   input files and build graphs in the zdrive program.

fdriver         -- Fortran version of driver, primarily used for testing
                   the Fortran interface.


OTHER DIRECTORIES
-----------------

test		-- Test problems in both Nemesis/Exodus and Chaco formats.
                   Also contains the script test_zoltan that runs the test 
                   driver with all the test problems.

util		-- Utility scripts.
