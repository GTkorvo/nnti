DOCUMENTATION
-------------
docs            -- Documentation for the Zoltan library.
docs/octree     -- Documentation for RPI's octree/SFC partitioner.  (Luis'
                   final report).

                   developer's guide.

ZOLTAN LIBRARY FILES
--------------------

Makefile        -- Top-level Zoltan Makefile.  Contains targets for compilation
                   on the 980 LAN.

Makefile_sub    -- Lower-level Makefile template.  Copied to Obj_target
                   directories when targets are compiled.

lb              -- Interface definitions, user data type definitions,
                   load-balancing data structure definitions, interface
                   functions, and functions related to the load-balancing
                   interface and migration-help tools.

comm            -- Routines from Hendrickson and Plimpton's unstructured
                   communication package.

all             -- Memory allocation functions.

par             -- Parallel computing utilities.

rcb             -- Steve Plimpton's implementation of Recursive Coordinate
                   Bisection.

oct             -- RPI's octree partitioning and space-filling curves 
                   algorithms.

OTHER CODE (not compiled into the Zoltan library)
-------------------------------------------------

driver          -- Driver program that reads exodus/nemesis files, runs
                   Zoltan and then writes out the new assignment vectors.
                   This program is compiled by making the <platform>-dr
                   target. Where <platform> is, currently, sun, tflop
                   or smos.

gr              -- Some graph manipulation routines using tree-based and
                   hash-table based implementations of graphs.  These 
                   routines were written before the load-balancing interface,
                   and, thus, have some outdated features (e.g., IDs should
                   be replaced by LB_GIDs).  These tools are only partially
                   developed.

vx              -- Some vertex manipulation routines that work with the 
                   graph routines in the gr directory.  These tools are only
                   partially developed.

id              -- Some object ID manipulation routines that work with the
                   graph routines in the gr directory.  These routines are
                   probably all outdated and should be replaced by the
                   LB_GID and LB_LID manipulation macros.  I'll keep them
                   around only because the graph routines may currently use
                   them.  Otherwise, they could be cvs removed.

ch              -- Routines developed by Hendrickson and Leland to read Chaco
                   input files and build graphs using the graph routines in
                   the gr directory.  They were developed in a (later 
                   discarded) attempt to read Chaco input files and balance
                   them with Zoltan.  The routines are only partially 
                   developed.

fort            -- William Mitchell's Fortran interface for Zoltan.  This
                   is currently under development and not compiled into
                   the library.
