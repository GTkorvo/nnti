Problems existing in Zoltan.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On failure, OCTREE, ParMETIS and Jostle methods abort rather than return 
error codes.

Problems existing in ParMETIS and reported to ParMETIS development team
at the University of Minnesota:

Name: load imbalance tolerance
Version: ParMETIS 2.0
Symptom: missing feature
Description:
   The load imbalance parameter UNBALANCE_FRACTION can
   only be set at compile-time. With Zoltan it is
   necessary to be able to set this parameter at run-time.
Reported: Reported to metis@cs.umn.edu on 19 Aug 1999.
Status: George Karypis said it will be fixed in the next release.


Name: no edges
Version: ParMETIS 2.0
Symptom: segmentation fault at run time
Description:
   ParMETIS crashes if the input graph has no edges and
   ParMETIS_PartKway is called. We suspect all the graph based
   methods crash. From the documentation it is unclear if
   a NULL pointer is a valid input for the adjncy array.
   However, the bug occurs both with NULL as input or
   a valid pointer to an array.
Reported: Reported to metis@cs.umn.edu on 5 Oct 1999.
Status: George Karypis said it will be fixed in the next release.


Name: no vertices
Version: ParMETIS 2.0
Symptom: segmentation fault at run time
Description:
   ParMETIS may crash if some procs own no vertices.
   The extent of this bug is not known (which methods, etc.).
   Again, it is unclear if NULL pointers are valid input.
Reported: Reported to metis@cs.umn.edu on 6 Oct 1999.
Status: No response.
