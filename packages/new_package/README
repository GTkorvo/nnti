	autotool'ed

The Trilinos/packages/new_package package was created as a tool for developers
wishing to utilize the Autotools configure/build process for a new or existing
package.  Before beginning this process, approval must be obtained from the
Trilinos Project Leader.

There are five general steps that need to be followed to add a new package to
the Trilinos Autotools configure/build process.  Note that these steps do not
have to be completed in the exact order listed below, nor does a step 
necessarily have to be completed in its entirety before moving onto the next
step.  (For example, a portion of a library can be autotool'ed and tested
before work begins on the rest of the library.)  The five steps are listed
below.

1. Write the non-generated files necessary for Autoconf and Automake.

Examples of all of the new, non-generated Autoconf and Automake files
required to add a packages to the Trilinos Autotools configure/build process 
are located within the new_package directory structure.  Most of these files
will need to be customized for each new package.  See the individual example 
files for more details.  Instructions for customizing are listed behind 
'#np#'.
(Details for all files not yet available.)  

2. Generate necessary Autoconf and Automake files.

After customizing ...

3. Connect the new package to the Trilinos Autotools configure/build process.
   (Establish build default=no)

This step involves...

4. Test and wait



5. Change build default to 'yes'

This step requires the separate approval of the Trilinos Project Leader!

Not all Trilinos packages should be configured and built by default.  Consult
with the Trilinos Project Leader for more information.

If approval to build by default is granted, ...
