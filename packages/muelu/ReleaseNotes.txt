Release Notes for Trilinos Package MueLu
-----------------------------------------

Trilinos 11.12
--------------

Trilinos 11.12 is the initial release of MueLu.

MueLu is an extensible multigrid library that is part of the Trilinos project.
MueLu works with Epetra (32- and 64-bit versions) and Tpetra matrix types. The
library is written in C++ and allows for different ordinal (index) and scalar
types. MueLu is designed to be efficient on many different computer
architectures, from workstations to supercomputers. While it is MPI based,
MueLu is relies on the "MPI+X" principle, where "X" can be threading or CUDA.

MueLu's software design allows for the rapid introduction of new multigrid
algorithms.

MueLu provides a number of different multigrid algorithms:
 - smoothed aggregation algebraic multigrid (AMG), appropriate for Poisson-like
   and elasticity problems
 - Petrov-Galerkin aggregation AMG for convection-diffusion problems
 - aggregation-based AMG for problems arising from the eddy current formulation
   of Maxwellâ€™s equations
