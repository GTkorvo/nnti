/*! \mainpage TSFCore::Nonlin : Fundamental interfaces for the development of steady-state nonlinear abstract numerical algorithms (ANAs)

<b>Warning!</b> Clicking on the above links (i.e. "Class List", "File
List" etc.)  can be a bit overwhelming and not recommended as a way to
"browse" what is in the Trilinos "package" %TSFCore.  Instead, it is
recommended that one use the below outline to browse the classes and
various functions in this package.  The one exception is the <a
href="./modules.html">"Modules"</a> link which is essentially an
outline of what is presented below.  The following presentation is
designed to expose developers to the contents of the %TSFCore package
in manageable chunks as to not overwhelm.  However, the above links
are very useful as a developer's reference and should only be used as
such.
