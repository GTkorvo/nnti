\section intro Introduction 
The Trilinos/packages/new_package package was created as a tool for developers
wishing to utilize the Autotools configure/build process for a new or existing
package.  Before beginning this process, approval must be obtained from the
Trilinos Project Leader.

See packages/new_package/README for more details

\section startup Overview of new_package

new_package contains two classes:

<ul> 

<li> Newp_Hello 
<li> Newp_Jambo (only if configured with --enable-newp_swahili)


</ul>

This documentations should not be taken as a guide.  I made it work
with doxygen and illustrated one or two features.  Nothing more.
