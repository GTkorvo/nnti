# This test comes from zoltan2/test/temp/multivectorTest.cpp.  It
# mimics the recursive bisection algorithm in Zoltan2, and times data
# migration.
#
# The test itself does not refer to MPI.  Hoewver, it only makes sense
# to run this test in an MPI build.  Otherwise, no data migration is
# necessary.
