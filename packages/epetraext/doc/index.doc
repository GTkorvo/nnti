\section EpetraExt_intro Introduction
EpetraExt is a set of extensions to Epetra.  To allow Epetra to remain
focused on it's primary functionality as a Linear Algebra object support,
EpetraExt was created to maintain additional support for such capabilities
as transformations (permutions, sub-block views, etc.), coloring support,
partitioning (Zoltan), and I/O.

\section EpetraExt_startup Overview of EpetraExt.

\subsection EpetraExt_formulations EpetraExt Classes

EpetraExt contains a number of classes.  They can be categorized as follows:

<ul> 

<li> EpetraExt::MatrixMatrix: Static Matrix Matrix Operations including Multiply and Add.

<li> Transforms: These classes derive from EpetraExt::Transform<T,U> allowing a common
     interface for transformation of epetra objects and migration of associated 
     data.

<ol>

<li> EpetraExt::Transform<T,U>: Abstract base for transformation of object of type T
     to object of type U.


<li> EpetraExt::Transform_Composite<T>: Allows the additive composition of 
     EpetraExt::SameTypeTransform<T>'s.

<li> Convertors: EpetraExt::LinearProblem_GraphTrans and EpetraExt::LinearProblem_MatrixTrans
     converts a EpetraExt::SameTypeTransform<Epetra_CrsGraph> and
     EpetraExt::SameTypeTransform<Epetra_CrsMatrix> to a EpetraExt::SameTypeTransform<Epetra_LinearProblem>

<li> EpetraExt::CrsGraph_Overlap: Forms the overlapped version of a distributed graph
     up to the user specified level.

<li> Reindexer's: Used to remap the global indexing of an existing Epetra object include
     EpetraExt::CrsMatrix_Reindex, EpetraExt::MultiVector_Reindex, and EpetraExt::LinearProblem_Reindex.

<li> EpetraExt::LinearProblem_Scale: Linear left and right scaling of a Epetra_LinearProblem

<li> Solver Mapping Tools: Remaps the columns of a CrsGraph or LinearProblem to meet the
     requirements of a square local block indexing for some linear solvers. Tools are
     EpetraExt::CrsGraph_SolverMap and EpetraExt::LinearProblem_SolverMap.

<li> EpetraExt::CrsGraph_SymmRCM: Perform a symmetric RCM for the local blocks of a
     Epetra_CrsGraph.

<li> Transpose: Form the explicit transpose of a Epetra_CrsGraph or Epetra_CrsMatrix.
     Tools are EpetraExt::CrsGraph_Transpose and EpetraExt::RowMatrix_Transpose.

<li> View: For sub-block views of existing Epetra objects including EpetraExt::CrsGraph_View,
     EpetraExt::CrsMatrix_View and EpetraExt::MultiVector_View

</ol>

<li> InOut: I/O operations for Epetra objects based on the Matrix Market
format. A binary reader based on HDF5 is available when EpetraExt is
configured with \c --enable-epetraext-hdf5. Tools are
EpetraExt::MatrixMarketFileToBlockMap,
EpetraExt::BlockMapToMatrixMarketFile,
EpetraExt::MatrixMarketFileToMap,
EpetraExt::MatrixMarketFileToCrsMatrix,
EpetraExt::RowMatrixToMatrixMarketFile,
EpetraExt::MatrixMarketFileToMultiVector,
EpetraExt::MultiVectorToMatrixMarketFile,
EpetraExt::MatrixMarketFileToVector,
EpetraExt::VectorToMatrixMarketFile,
and class EpetraExt::HDF5.


<li> Coloring: Helper tools for generating Finite Differencing Colorings of Linear Problems.

<li> Zoltan Tools: Primarily tools for generation of repartitioned Epetra objects using
     the Zoltan library.
     
<li> Matlab: Communication interface between Epetra and Matlab.  Exports Epetra objects to Matlab and imports objects from Matlab.
     Sends user specified Matlab commands to the Matlab engine to modify the Matlab workspace which provides user interaction with the Matlab engine.

<li> Nonlinear Model Evaluator: <tt>EpetraExt::ModelEvaluator</tt> provides an
Epetra-specific interface to nonlinear models for use by equation solvers all the
way up to optimization.

</ul>

\section EpetraExt_adapters EpetraExt adapters

The EpetraExt pacakge can also optionally support adapters to various
interfaces.  Support for these adapters can be turned on at configure time.

<ul>

<li> <a href="../../thyra/doc/html/index.html">EpetraExt/Thyra
Adapters</a>: These adapters implement various advanced %Thyra interfaces in
terms of %EpetraExt code.

</ul>

\section EpetraExt_browser Browse all of Epetraext as a single doxygen collection

You can browse all of EpetraExt as a <A HREF="../../browser/doc/html/index.html">single
doxygen collection</A>. Warning, this is not the recommended way to learn
about EpetraExt software.  However, this is a good way to browse the <a
href="../../browser/doc/html/dirs.html">directory structure of epetraext</a>, to <a
href="../../browser/doc/html/files.html">locate files</a>, etc.
