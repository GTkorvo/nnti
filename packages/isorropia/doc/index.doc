User warning: Isorropia is in the early stages of development. We are still
going through requirements-prototyping cycles, so everything is still changing
frequently. (including function-names, file-names, etc.)

\subsection isorropia_functions Isorropia Functions

Currently Isorropia's user interface consists of the Partitioner and
Redistributor classes, and the 
<a href="namespaceIsorropia.html">create_balanced_copy functions</a>,
which take an input object (either Epetra_CrsGraph or Epetra_CrsMatrix)
and return a copy which is balanced across partitions.
