\section isorropia_intro Introduction

Isorropia is a repartitioning/rebalancing package, intended to assist
with redistributing objects such as matrices and matrix-graphs in a
parallel execution setting, to allow for more efficient computations.
To enable Isorropia in your Trilinos build, provide the argument
'--enable-isorropia' to configure.

Isorropia is primarily an interface to the Zoltan library, but can be
built and used with minimal capability without Zoltan. To enable Isorropia's
Zoltan support, you need to add '--enable-isorropia-zoltan' and
'--enable-epetraext' to your Trilinos configure command, and provide
include-paths and library specifications
for Zoltan version 2.0 (provide these to configure using the
'--with-incdirs' and '--with-libs' configure arguments).

\section isorropia_startup Overview of Isorropia.

Isorropia's user interface consists of the Isorropia::Partitioner and
Isorropia::Redistributor classes, and the
Isorropia::create_balanced_copy functions.

The Isorropia::create_balanced_copy functions are free-standing functions
(not class members) which simply take an input object (Epetra_CrsGraph,
Epetra_CrsMatrix, etc.) and return a copy which is balanced across
partitions.

For more sophisticated use-cases, such as performing one partitioning
and then using it to redistribute multiple objects, it is more
efficient to use the Partitioner and Redistributor classes.

Isorropia::Partitioner is an interface class (abstract base class), and
currently the only implementation of this interface is the
Isorropia::EpetraPartitioner class.

\section zoltanparams Passing parameters through to Zoltan

Some Isorropia classes accept a Teuchos::ParameterList object. To
specify that Zoltan be used to perform the partitioning, create a
sublist with name "Zoltan" in the parameter-list object. Then, any
parameters that should be passed to Zoltan itself, can be stored in
the sublist exactly as they appear in the Zoltan users guide. Example:
\verbatim
  Teuchos::ParameterList params;
  Teuchos::ParameterList& sublist = params.sublist("Zoltan");
  sublist.set("LB_METHOD", "GRAPH");
  sublist.set("PARMETIS_METHOD", "PARTKWAY");
\endverbatim
Refer to the Zoltan users guide (available at
<a href=http://www.cs.sandia.gov/zoltan>www.cs.sandia.gov/zoltan</a>)
for available Zoltan parameters.

\section isorropia_example Example Codes

A couple of example programs which demonstrate using Isorropia are
provided in the 'packages/isorropia/example' subdirectory.

The following is packages/isorropia/example/part_redist.cpp:

\verbinclude ../example/part_redist.cpp
