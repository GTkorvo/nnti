This directory (isorropia/example) contains a number of example programs
that demonstrate using Isorropia to rebalance Epetra objects.

The programs can be run like this (for example):
% mpirun -np 2 part_redist.exe

(You may need a different mpirun command depending on your particular
system.)

See test/mtx/test_simple.mtx for a better example of hypergraph
partitioning.  Hypergraphs are not in general sqare and symmetric.
