This directory (isorropia/example/matrix_1) contains an example program
which demonstrates using Isorropia::create_balanced_copy to rebalance
an Epetra_CrsGraph and a Epetra_CrsMatrix.

The program can be run like this:
% mpirun -np 2 matrix_1.exe

(You may need a different mpirun command depending on your particular
system.)

The program is known to work on 1,2,3,4,5 or 6 processors. (It should
work on virtually any number of processors.)
