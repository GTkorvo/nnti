/**
 * Reads a file from the file name path passed to it, and then reads in a host per line in the format:<br>
 * <code>host:port</code><br>
 * The port number will be added to the default port value specified by
 * <code>import java.rmi.registry.Registry;</code>.
 *<p>
 * To deal with the fact that InetAddress.getLocalHost() has some very odd behavior
 * and the fact that machines may have more than one valid IP address
 * this modification uses NetworkInterface.getByInetAddress to determine if
 * the IP address specified is bound to any local network interface.
 * Effectivly this means that any local interface or IP can be used.
 *<p>
 * The terminology here is a mix of that from Jpetra and CCJ.
 *<p>
 * NOTE/BUGS: Additional error checking should be included to eliminate the ability
 * to specify loopback interfaces as valid IPs.  Also, the first IP found to be bound
 * to an interface will be used.  This will prevent multiple processes on the same
 * physical node from using multiple IP addresses.
