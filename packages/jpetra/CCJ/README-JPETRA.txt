This is a modified version of CCJ, and will continually be modified.  Jpetra will only
work with this version avaliable from CVS at software.sandia.gov.

The examples and Java Grande (jg-bench) benchmarks have not been updated to work with this release.
To use the examples, a file with ccjhosts must be supplied to the constructor of ColGroupMaster as the only argument.
For more information see on how to do this, see the Jpetra documentation under CcjComm and CcjLink and view their source files.
