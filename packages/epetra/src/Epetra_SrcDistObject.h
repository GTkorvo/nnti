//! Epetra_SrcDistObject: A class for supporting flexible source distributed objects for import/export operations.

/*! The Epetra_SrcDistObject is a base class for all Epetra distributed global objects that are potential 
    source objects for the general Epetra_DistObject class.  It provides a way to send a very general distributed
    object as the potential source object for an import or export object.  For example, it is possible to pass
    an Epetra_RowMatrix object as the source object for an import/export where the target is an Epetra_CrsMatrix, or
    an Epetra_CrsGraph (where the RowMatrix values will be ignored).
