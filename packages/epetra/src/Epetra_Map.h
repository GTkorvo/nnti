//! Epetra_Map: A class for partitioning vectors and matrices.

/*! It is often the case that multiple matrix and vector objects have an identical distribution 
  of elements on a parallel machine. The Epetra_Map class keep information that describes 
  this distribution for matrices and vectors.  

  Epetra_Map allows the storage and retrieval of the following information.  Depending on the
  constructor that is used, some of the information is defined by the user and some is 
  determined by the constructor.  Once a Epetra_Map is constructed any of the following attributes can 
  be obtained
  by calling a query function that has the name as the attribute, e.g. to get the
  value of NumGlobalEquations, you can call a function NumGlobalElements().  For attributes that
  are lists, the query functions return the list values in a user allocated array.

  <ul>
  <li> NumGlobalElements - The total number of elements across all processors. If this parameter and
       NumMyElements are both passed in to the constructor, one of the three cases will apply: 
       <ol> 
       <li> If NumGlobalElements = NumMyElements (and not equal to zero)
            the map is defined to be a local replicated
            map.  In this case, objects constructed using this map will be identically replicated across
	    all processors in the communicator.
       <li> If NumGlobalElements = 0 and NumMyElements is passed in then NumGlobalElements will
            be computed as the sum of NumMyElements across all processors.
       <li> If neither of the above is true, NumGlobalElements will be checked against the sum of 
            NumMyElements across all processors.  An error is issued if the comparison is not equal.
       </ol>
  <li> NumMyElements - The number of elements owned by the calling processor.
  <li> MyGlobalElements - A list of length NumMyElements that contains the global element IDs
       of the elements owned by the calling processor.
  <li> IndexBase - The base integer value for indexed array references.  Typically this is 0
       for C/C++ and 1 for Fortran, but it can be set to any integer value.
  <li> Comm - The Epetra_Comm communicator.  This communicator can in turn be queried for
       processor rank and size information.
  </ul>


  In addition to the information above that is passed in to or created by the Epetra_Map constructor,
  the following attributes are computed and available via query to the user using the same scheme
  as above, e.g., use NumGlobalEquations() to get the value of NumGlobalEquations.

  <ul>
  <li> NumGlobalEquations - The total number of equations across all processors.
  <li> NumMyEquations - The number of equations on the calling processor.
  <li> MinAllGID - The minimum global index value across all processors.
  <li> MaxAllGID - The maximum global index value across all processors.
  <li> MinMyGID - The minimum global index value on the calling processor.
  <li> MaxMyGID - The maximum global index value on the calling processor.
  <li> MinLID - The minimum local index value on the calling processor.
  <li> MaxLID - The maximum local index value on the calling processor.
  </ul>

  The following functions allow boolean tests for certain properties.    

  <ul>
  <li> LinearMap() - Returns true if the elements are distributed linear across processors, i.e.,
       processor 0 gets the first n/p elements, processor 1 gets the next n/p elements, etc. where
       n is the number of elements and p is the number of processors.
  <li> DistributedGlobal() - Returns true if the element space of the map spans more than one processor.
       This will be true in most cases, but will be false on in serial and for objects
       that are created via the derived Epetra_LocalMap class.
  </ul>

  \warning A Epetra_Comm object is required for all Epetra_Map constructors.

  \note In the current implementation, Epetra_BlockMap is the base class for Epetra_Map.
