//! Epetra_IntSerialDenseMatrix: A class for constructing and using general dense integer matrices.

/*! The Epetra_IntSerialDenseMatrix class enables the construction and use of integer-valued, general
    dense matrices. 

The Epetra_IntSerialDenseMatrix class is intended to provide very basic support for dense rectangular matrices.


<b>Constructing Epetra_IntSerialDenseMatrix Objects</b>

There are three Epetra_IntSerialDenseMatrix constructors.  The first constructs a zero-sized object which should be made
to appropriate length using the Shape() or Reshape() functions and then filled with the [] or () operators. 
The second is a constructor that accepts user
data as a 2D array, the third is a copy constructor. The second constructor has
two data access modes (specified by the Epetra_DataAccess argument):
<ol>
  <li> Copy mode - Allocates memory and makes a copy of the user-provided data. In this case, the
       user data is not needed after construction.
  <li> View mode - Creates a "view" of the user data. In this case, the
       user data is required to remain intact for the life of the object.
</ol>

\warning View mode is \e extremely dangerous from a data hiding perspective.
Therefore, we strongly encourage users to develop code using Copy mode first and 
only use the View mode in a secondary optimization phase.

<b>Extracting Data from Epetra_IntSerialDenseMatrix Objects</b>

Once a Epetra_IntSerialDenseMatrix is constructed, it is possible to view the data via access functions.

\warning Use of these access functions cam be \e extremely dangerous from a data hiding perspective.


<b>Vector and Utility Functions</b>

Once a Epetra_IntSerialDenseMatrix is constructed, several mathematical functions can be applied to
the object.  Specifically:
<ul>
  <li> Multiplication.
  <li> Norms.
</ul>
