//! Epetra_SerialDenseMatrix: A class for constructing and using real double precision general dense matrices.

/*! The Epetra_SerialDenseMatrix class enables the construction and use of real-valued, general, 
    double-precision dense matrices.  It is built on the BLAS, and derives from the Epetra_BLAS. 

The Epetra_SerialDenseMatrix class is intended to provide very basic support for dense rectangular matrices.


<b>Constructing Epetra_SerialDenseMatrix Objects</b>

There are three Epetra_SerialDenseMatrix constructors.  The first constructs a zero-sized object which should be made
to appropriate length using the Shape() or Reshape() functions and then filled with the [] or () operators. 
The second is a constructor that accepts user
data as a 2D array, the third is a copy constructor. The second constructor has
two data access modes (specified by the Epetra_DataAccess argument):
<ol>
  <li> Copy mode - Allocates memory and makes a copy of the user-provided data. In this case, the
       user data is not needed after construction.
  <li> View mode - Creates a "view" of the user data. In this case, the
       user data is required to remain intact for the life of the object.
</ol>

\warning View mode is \e extremely dangerous from a data hiding perspective.
Therefore, we strongly encourage users to develop code using Copy mode first and 
only use the View mode in a secondary optimization phase.

<b>Extracting Data from Epetra_SerialDenseMatrix Objects</b>

Once a Epetra_SerialDenseMatrix is constructed, it is possible to view the data via access functions.

\warning Use of these access functions cam be \e extremely dangerous from a data hiding perspective.


<b>Vector and Utility Functions</b>

Once a Epetra_SerialDenseMatrix is constructed, several mathematical functions can be applied to
the object.  Specifically:
<ul>
  <li> Multiplication.
  <li> Norms.
</ul>

The final useful function is Flops().  Each Epetra_SerialDenseMatrix object keep track of the number
of \e serial floating point operations performed using the specified object as the \e this argument
to the function.  The Flops() function returns this number as a double precision number.  Using this 
information, in conjunction with the Epetra_Time class, one can get accurate parallel performance
numbers.
