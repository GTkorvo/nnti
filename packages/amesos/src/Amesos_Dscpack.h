//! Amesos_Dscpack:  An object-oriented wrapper for Dscpack.
/*!  Amesos_Dscpack will solve a linear systems of equations: <TT>A X = B</TT>
   using Epetra objects and the Dscpack solver library, where
  <TT>A</TT> is an Epetra_RowMatrix and <TT>X</TT> and <TT>B</TT> are 
  Epetra_MultiVector objects.

  Dscpack execution can be tuned through a variety of parameters.
  Amesos_Dscpack.h allows control of these parameters through the
  following named parameters, ignoring parameters with names that it
  does not recognize.  Where possible, the parameters are common to
  all direct solvers (although some may ignore them).  However, some
  parameters, in particular tuning parameters, are unique to each
  solver.
