As of July 10, 2003 five tests run under the testharness:
  AmesosShortScript - A test of SuperLUdist
  AmesosDscpack 
  AmesosUmfpack 
  AmesosSuperLUserial - A test of SuperLUserial
  AmesosUmfackSerial - Umfpack bilt without MPI
All five of these tests pass on all five platforms.
Some of the longer tests hang occasionally on my laptop under cygwin.
I can't seem to get testharness to work properly on Paunchy, so I ran those by hand.
testharness also fails on Stratus, but the Amesos tests work there.  


Here are the results for some other tests:  
  AmesosShell (A more copmlete test of SuperLUdist) fails on herouxsmp, paunchy and stratus.  
The failures on herouxsmp adn paunchy are in bcsstk18.  The failures in stratus are in 
bcsstk18 (except for a couple fidapm15 errors with errors slightly too large).  

Refer to the other .summary files for details.
