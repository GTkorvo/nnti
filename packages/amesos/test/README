Organization of Amesos tests:
(M. Sala, SNL 9214, Sep-04)

- Test_Epetra_RowMatrix
  =====================

  The linear system matrix is an Epetra_RowMatrix object, 
  that is not derived from either Epetra_CrsMatrix or Epetra_VbrMatrix. 
  Multiple RHS are tested.

  Tests for default options only, with matrix and its transpose.

  Amesos_Descpack is NOT tested.

- Test_Epetra_CrsMatrix
  =====================

  The linear system matrix is an Epetra_CrsMatrix.
  Multiple RHS are tested.

  Tests for default options only, with matrix and its transpose.

- Test_Epetra_VbrMatrix
  The linear system matrix is an Epetra_CrsMatrix.
  Multiple RHS are tested.

  Tests for default options only, with matrix and its transpose.

  Amesos_Descpack is NOT tested.

- Test_Detailed
  =============

  The linear system matrix is an Epetra_RowMatrix object, 
  that is not derived from either Epetra_CrsMatrix or Epetra_VbrMatrix. 
  Transpose it NOT tested.
  Multiple RHS are tested.

  Test the behavior of SymbolicFactorization(), NumericFactorization(),
  and Solve(). For a given problem, the matrix, RHS and solution are
  changed in several ways (values and underlying maps).

  Amesos_Descpack is NOT tested.

- Test_MultipleSolves
  ===================
  
  The linear system matrix is an Epetra_CrsMatrix.
  Transpose it NOT tested.
  Multiple RHS are tested.

  Test multiple successive solutions with different rhs, to
  solve A^3 x = b.
