Examples of IFPACK
==================

The user might want to look through the examples in the following
order:

- Ifpack_ex_Factory.cpp     shows how to use Ifpack factory to create
                            a variety of IFPACK preconditioners.
			    This is the simplest way to use IFPACK.
			    The example details all the phases of
			    IFPACK. Difficulty = beginners.

- Ifpack_ex_Amesos.cpp      shows how to use exact LU solvers on
                            each subdomain, using Amesos. This example
			    is very similar to the previous one.
			    Difficulty = beginners.

- Ifpack_ex_Ict.cpp         shows how to define incomplete Cholesky 
                            factorizations and tune parameters. Although
			    an ICT factorization can be constructed using
			    the Factory (as done in file
			    Ifpack_ex_Factory.cpp), this example tells
			    the real story: how to define an 
			    Ifpack_AdditiveSchwar which uses ICT on
			    each subdomain.
			    Difficulty: intermediate.

- Ifpack_ex_BlockPrec.cpp   shows how to define block preconditioner
                            in the more general case, using
			    Ipfack_AdditiveSchwarz.
			    Difficulty: advanced.

The examples require triutils (--enable-triutils) to generate the linear
system matrix, and AztecOO (--enable-aztecoo) to solve the corresponding
linear system. Ifpack_ex_Amesos.cpp requires Amesos (--enable-amesos).
