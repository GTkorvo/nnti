\section intro Introduction
IFPACK provides a suite of object-oriented algebraic preconditioners
for the solution of preconditioned iterative solvers.  IFPACK
constructors expect an Epetra_RowMatrix object for construction.
IFPACK is part of the Trilinos Solver Project and IFPACK object
interact well with other Trilinos classes.  In particular, IFPACK can
be used as a preconditioner for AztecOO.
