\section{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The parallel solution of large linear systems of type
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:linear_sys}
A {x} = {b}
\end{equation}
is often achieved using iterative solvers of Krylov type (see for
instance~\cite{barret93templates}).
It is well known that the convergence of Krylov methods depends on 
the spectral properties of the linear system matrix
$A$~\cite{axelsson94iterative,saad96iterative,QSS}. Hence, the
original system~(\ref{eq:linear_sys}) is often replaced by
\[
P^{-1} A{u} = P^{-1} {f}
\]
(left-preconditioning), or by
\[
A P^{-1} P {u} = {f}
\]
(right-preconditioning), using a linear transformation $P^{-1}$,
called {\sl preconditioner}, in order to improve the spectral properties of
the linear system matrix. In general terms, a preconditioner is any
kind of transformation applied to the original system which makes it
easier to solve.

The general (and challenging) problem of finding an efficient
preconditioner is to identify a linear operator $P$ with the following
properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf $P$ is a good approximation of $A$ is some sense}. Although no
  general theory is available, we can say that $P$ should act so that
  $P^{-1} A$ is near to being the identity matrix and its eigenvalues
  are clustered within a sufficiently small region of the complex plane 
  (see for instance~\cite{greenbaum97iterative});
\item {\bf $P$ is efficient}, in the sense that the iteration method converges
  much faster, in terms of CPU time, for the preconditioned system.  In
  other words, preconditioners must be selected in such a way that the
  cost of constructing and using them is offset by the improved
  convergence properties they permit to achieve;
\item {\bf $P$ or $P^{-1}$ can be constructed in parallel}, to take advantage of the architecture of modern supercomputers.
\end{enumerate}

The choice of $P$ varies from ``black-box'' algebraic techniques which
can be applied to general matrices to ``problem dependent''
preconditioners which exploit special features of a particular class
of problems. Although problem dependent preconditioners can be very
powerful, there is still a practical need for efficient
preconditioning techniques for large classes of problems. \ifpack\ aims to
fill the need for general, black-box preconditioners, by providing a set of
robust algebriac preconditioners for parallel large scale applications.

\ifpack\ contains four main classes of preconditioners:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Simple point preconditioners}, 
  like Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, SOR and SSOR.
  These schemes seldomly provide satisfactory performances as stand-alone
  preconditioner, but can be very effective if used as smoothers in
  multilevel methods (like, for example, ML~\cite{ml-guide});
\item {\bf Polynomial preconditioner}, like Neumann, Least-Square, and
Chebyshev (currently under development);
\item {\bf Incomplete Factorizations preconditioner}, like ILU(k), RILU(k);
\item {\bf One-level domain decomposition preconditioners of Schwarz type},
  with minimal or larger overlap among the subdomains. The local linear problems
  can be solved with exact factorizations, incomplete factorizations, or
  {\sl any} other \ifpack\ preconditioner documented in this manual. 
  For example, each subdomain matrix
  can be furtherly decomposed into subdomains, and block preconditioner can be
  applied to solve the local problem. 
\end{enumerate}

\smallskip

The goal of this document is to provide an overview of all \ifpack\
  preconditioners. Several examples are reported to illustrate how to define
  and use \ifpack\ objects. Further details can be found on the Doxygen
  documentation.

The manuscript is organized as follows. A general description of \ifpack\
  preconditioners is reported in Section~\ref{sec:prec}.
Section~\ref{sec:point} presents the point preconditioners. 
Section~\ref{sec:block} details the block preconditioners.
Section~\ref{sec:ilu} outlines the incomplete factorizations of \ifpack.
Section~\ref{sec:additive} describes how to define additive Schwarz 
preconditioner, with minimal or wider overlap. 
Finally, Section~\ref{sec:config}
illustrates the configuration option of \ifpack.

\section{General Description of \ifpack\ Preconditioners}
\label{sec:prec}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

All \ifpack\ preconditioners described in this document
are reported in Table~\ref{tab:all_prec}. They are all derived from the 
\verb!Ifpack_Preconditioner.h!
class (see Figure~\ref{fig:if_prec}).

solve the local problems. See Section~\ref{sec:additive}. \\

\end{sidewaystable}

\verb!Ifpack_Preconditioner.h! is a pure virtual class, derived from
\verb!Epetra_Operator!, that standarizes the construction of \ifpack\
preconditioners. In fact, all \ifpack\ preconditioners are supposed to behave
as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The object is constructed, passing as only input argument the
pointer of the matrix to be preconditioned;
\item All the parameters, stored in a \teuchos\ parameters list, are
set using method \verb!SetParameters()!. If \verb!SetParameters()! is not
called, default values will be used;
\item The preconditioner is constructed by calling method \verb!Compute()!.
\item Method \verb!ApplyInverse()! applies the preconditioner. Any class that
uses \verb!ApplyInverse()! to apply the preconditioner can take advantage of
an \verb!Ifpack_Preconditioner! derived object.
\item Method \verb!IsComputed()! returns {\tt true} is the preconditioner has
been successfully computed, {\tt false} otherwise.
\item Method \verb!Condest()! returns an estimation of the condition
number of the preconditioned system, or -1.0 if not available.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{remark}
Some \ifpack\ preconditioners may require to copy the input \verb!List! object
given 
in input to \\ \verb!SetParameters()!. As the input list is copied, it 
can go out of scope before \verb!Compute()! is called. Besides, changes to
\verb!List! will not affect the preconditioner, unless \verb!SetParameters()!
is re-called.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
The condition of a matrix $B$, called $cond_p(B)$, is defined as
$cond_p(B) = \|B\|_p\|B^{-1}\|_p$ in some appropriate norm $p$. 
$cond_p(B)$
gives some indication of how many accurate floating point
digits can be expected from operations involving the matrix and its
inverse.  A condition number approaching the accuracy of a given
floating point number system, about 15 decimal digits in IEEE double
precision, means that any results involving $B$ or $B^{-1}$ may be
meaningless.

The $\infty$-norm of a vector $y$ is defined as the maximum of the
absolute values of the vector entries, and the $\infty$-norm of a
matrix C is defined as
$\|C\|_\infty = \max_{\|y\|_\infty = 1} \|Cy\|_\infty$.
A crude lower bound for the $cond_\infty(C)$ is
$\|C^{-1}e\|_\infty$ where $e = (1, 1, \ldots, 1)^T$.  It is a
lower bound because $cond_\infty(C) = \|C\|_\infty\|C^{-1}\|_\infty
\ge \|C^{-1}\|_\infty \ge |C^{-1}e\|_\infty$. Several \ifpack\
  preconditioners make use of
$\|C^{-1}e\|_\infty$ to estimate the condition number.
\end{remark}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Point Preconditioners}
\label{sec:point}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\ifpack\ contains a set of simple point preconditioners based on relaxation.
Beginning with a given approximate solution, these methods modify the
components of the approximation, one or a few at a time and in a certain order,
until convergence is reached. Although still popular in some application
areas, these preconditioners are now
rarely used; however, they can provide successful smoothers for multilevel
methods. 

All \ifpack\ point preconditioners are based on the decomposition
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:splitting}
A = D - E - F,
\end{equation}
where $D$ is the diagonal part of $A$, $-E$ the strict lower part, and 
$-F$ the strict upper part. It is always assumed that the diagonal entries of
$A$ are all nonzero.

The parameters that affect the \ifpack\ point preconditioners are reported
below\footnote{We note that all parameters must be spelled as indicated.
  Misspelled parameters will be ignored. Parameters are case sensitive. Words
  are separated by one space only.}.

\smallskip

\choicebox{\tt point: sweeps}{[{\tt int}] Number of sweeps (or steps) of the
  preconditioner. Default: {\tt 1}.}

\choicebox{\tt point: damping factor}{[{\tt double}] This is the value for $\omega$ 
  in formulae (\ref{eq:jacobi}), (\ref{eq:gs}), (\ref{eq:sor}) and
    (\ref{eq:ssor}). Default: {\tt 1.0}.}
				 
\choicebox{\tt point: print frequency}{[{\tt int}] If not zero, prints out
  convergence information every specified number of sweeps. Note: This is
    intended for debugging purposes, as the computation of the residual
    requires a distributed matrix-vector product. Default: {\tt 0}}

\choicebox{\tt point: zero starting solution}{[{\tt bool}] If {\tt true},
  the starting solution is always the zero vector. If {\tt false} and 
   {\tt point: sweeps} is greater than one, the starting solution is
  as specified by the user in method {\tt ApplyInverse()}.
    Default: {\tt true}.}

\choicebox{\tt point: compute condest}{[{\tt bool}] If {\tt true},
compute the estimated condition number of the preconditioned system.
  Default: {\tt false}.}

\medskip

\begin{remark}
All preconditioners will use the zero vector as starting solution.
\end{remark}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Point Jacobi Preconditioner}
\label{sec:jacobi}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given a starting solution $x^{(0)}$, the (damped) Jacobi method determines 
the $i-$th component of 
solution of (\ref{eq:linear_sys}) at step $k \geq 1$ as
\[
a_{i,i} x^{(k)}_i = \omega \; \left[  \;- \sum_{j \neq n} a_{i,j} x^{(k-1)} + b_i
\; \right]
\]
where $\omega$ is the damping parameter and
$a_{i,j}$ the $(i,j)$ element of matrix $A$\footnote{Clearly, is used as a
  solver, $\omega$ must be set to 1 to converge to the solution of
    (\ref{eq:linear_sys}).}.
This component-wise equation can be rewritten in a vector form as
\[
x^{(k)} = \omega \; \left[ \; D^{-1} (E+F) x ^{(k-1)} + D^{-1} b \; \right],
\]
or, equivalently,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:jacobi}
x^{(k)} = x^{(k-1)} + \omega D^{-1} (b - A x ^{(k-1)} ) ,
\end{equation}
where $r^{(k-1)} = b - A x ^{(k-1)}$ is the residual at step $k-1$. 

If used as a preconditioner, the Jacobi method results in
a symmetric preconditioner.
The starting solution is the zero vector.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Point Gauss-Seidel Preconditioner}
\label{sec:gs}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The (damped) Gauss-Seidel method at step $k \geq 1$ can be written as
\[
a_{i,i} x^{(k)}_i = \omega \; 
 \left[- \sum_{j<i} a_{i,j} x^{(k)} 
			   - \sum_{j>i} a_{i,j} x^{(k-1)} + b_i
			   \; \right]
\]
where $\omega$ is the damping parameter. In vector form, one has
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:gs}
x^{(k)} = x^{(k-1)} + \omega (D - E)^{-1} (b - A x ^{(k-1)} ) ,
\end{equation}
which requires, at each step $k$, the solution of a (lower) triangular 
linear system. The resulting preconditioner is non-symmetric.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Point SOR Preconditioner}
\label{sec:sor}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Successive Over Relaxation (SOR) method computes the $k$-th step 
using the relaxation sequence
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sor}
x^{(k)} = \omega x_{GS}^{(k-1)} + (1 - \omega) x^{(k-1)}, 
\end{equation}
where $x_{GS}^{(k-1)}$ is the $k-1$ step of a (non-damped) Gauss-Seidel
iteration. SOR is based on the splitting 
\[
\omega A = (D - \omega E) - (\omega F + (1 - \omega) D ) ,
\]
so that (\ref{eq:sor}) can also be written as
\[
(D - \omega E) x^{(k)} = \left[
\omega F + (1 - \omega ) D
\right] x^{(k-1)} + \omega b.
\]
The resulting preconditioner is non-symmetric.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Point SSOR Preconditioner}
\label{sec:ssor}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Symmetric SOR (SSOR) step consist of the SOR step (\ref{eq:sor}) followed by
a backward SOR,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ssor}
\begin{array}{rcl}
(D - \omega E) x^{(k-1/2)} &= &[ \omega F - (1 - \omega)D] x^{(k-1)} + \omega b \\
(D - \omega F) x^{(k)} &=& [ \omega E - (1 - \omega)D] x^{(k-1/2)} + \omega b .
\end{array}
\end{equation}
The resulting preconditioner is symmetric. When $\omega = 1$, the method
is often called symmetric Gauss-Seidel.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Example of Use of Point Preconditioners}
\label{sec:point_ex}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, a Gauss-Seidel preconditioner (later discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:gs}) can be constructed and used as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
#include "Teuchos_ParameterList.hpp"
#include "Ifpack_GaussSeidel.h"
\end{verbatim}
Let \verb!A! be a pointer to an \verb!Epetra_RowMatrix! derived object,
  and let \verb!Problem! be a pointer to an \verb!Epetra_LinearMatrix!.
\begin{verbatim}
Epetra_RowMatrix* A;  
Epetra_LinearProblem* Problem;
\end{verbatim}
We suppose that \verb!A! and 
\verb!Problem! are properly set, and
method \verb~FillComplete()~ has been called. At this point, we can create teh
preconditioner as
\begin{verbatim}
Teuchos::ParameterList List;

Ifpack_GaussSeidel Prec(A);

IFPACK_CHK_ERR(Prec.SetParameters(List));
IFPACK_CHK_ERR(Prec.Compute());
\end{verbatim}
Now, we can set the IFPACK preconditioner for AztecOO:
\begin{verbatim}
AztecOO AztecOOProblem(Problem);
AztecOOProblem.SetPrecOperator(Prec);
\end{verbatim}
as call \verb!AztecOO.Iterate()! as required.

Macro \verb!IFPACK_CHK_ERR()! can be used to check return values. If the
return value if different from 0, the macro prints out a warning message on
\verb!cerr!, and returns.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Block Preconditioners}
\label{sec:block}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Block preconditioners of Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel type generalize their point
counterpart by updating a set of variables at the same time. Consider
to partition the matrix $A$, the right-hand side and the solution vector
as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:partition}
A = 
\left(
\begin{array}{c c c c c}
A_{1,1} & A_{1,2} & A_{1,3} & \ldots & A_{1,m} \\
A_{2,1} & A_{2,2} & A_{2,3} & \ldots & A_{2,m} \\
A_{3,1} & A_{3,2} & A_{3,3} & \ldots & A_{3,m} \\
\vdots  & \vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
A_{m,1} & A_{m,2} & A_{m,3} & \ldots & A_{m,m} \\
\end{array}
\right),
  \;\;\;
x = 
\left(
\begin{array}{c c c c c}
x_{1} \\
x_{2} \\
x_{3} \\
\vdots  \\
x_{m}
\end{array}
\right), \;\;\;
b = 
\left(
\begin{array}{c c c c c}
b_{1} \\
b_{2} \\
b_{3} \\
\vdots  \\
b_{m}
\end{array}
\right),
\end{equation}
in which the partitioning of $x$ and $b$ block $m$ blocks is compatible with the partitioning
of $A$. Also, it is supposed that the diagonal blocks $A_{i,i}$ are square
and assumed nonsingular.

Now, splitting (\ref{eq:splitting}) can still be used to define block Jacobi
and block Gauss-Seidel algorithms, with the following definitions of $D$, $E$
and $F$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:D}
D = 
\left(
\begin{array}{c c c c c}
A_{1,1} &         &         &        &          \\
        & A_{2,2} &         &        &          \\
        &         & A_{1,3} &        &          \\
        &         &         & \ddots &         \\
        &         &         &        & A_{m,m} \\
\end{array}
\right), 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:E}
E =  -
\left(
\begin{array}{c c c c c}
 O      &         &         &        &          \\
A_{2,1} & O       &         &        &          \\
A_{3,1} & A_{3,2} & O       &        &          \\
 \vdots & \vdots  &         & \ddots &         \\
A_{m,1} & A_{m,2} & A_{m,3} & \ldots &     O    \\
\end{array}
\right), 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:F}
F =  -
\left(
\begin{array}{c c c c c}
 O      & A_{1,2} & A_{1,3} & \ldots & A_{1,m}  \\
        & O       & A_{2,3} & \ldots & A_{2,m}  \\
        &         & O       &        &          \\
        &         &         & \ddots &         \\
        &         &         &        &     O    \\
\end{array}
\right), 
\end{equation}

Using definitions (\ref{eq:D}), (\ref{eq:E}) and (\ref{eq:F}), the block
Jacobi method is simply as reported in equation (\ref{eq:jacobi}). Analogously,
the block Gauss-Seidel is still described by equation (\ref{eq:gs}).

From the point of view of the implementation, instead, block preconditioner
are sensibly more complex than their point counterpart:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A strategy to define the blocks has to be chosen (for instance, 
a linear partitioner, or a graph decomposition algortithm);
\item block Jacobi and block Gauss-Seidel algorithms require the application
of the inverse of each diagonal block $A_{i,i}$. Blocks of small dimension
should be stored as dense matrices, while larger blocks require sparse
storage. In this latter case, to apply the inverse of the block can be
reformulated as applying a preconditioner for matrix
$A_{i,i}$.
The code must allow for different choices of block preconditioners.
\end{enumerate}

\smallskip

Let us start with the definition of the blocks. 
\ifpack\ provides the following options:
\begin{itemize}
\item a linear partitioning, using class \verb!Ifpack_LinearPartitioner!;
\item a simple greedy algorithm, using class \verb!Ipfack_GreedyPartitioner!;
\item an interface to METIS, using class \verb!Ifpack_METISPartitioner!.
\end{itemize}
It is important to note that all blocks are {\sl local} -- that is, 
  all partitioner schemes will {\sl always} decompose the local graph 
  only\footnote{If used in conjuction with class {\tt Ifpack\_AdditiveSchwarz},
    blocks can span more than one processor. See
      Section~\ref{sec:additive}.}

All \ifpack\ partitioners are derived from the pure virtual class
\verb!Ifpack_Partitioner!, and all require in the constructor phase
an \verb!Ifpack_Graph! object. \verb!Ifpack_Graph!'s can be easily
created (as light-weigth) conversions from \verb!Epetra_RowMatrix!'s
and \verb!Epetra_CrsGraph!'s, as follows At this point, we can create teh
preconditioner as
\begin{verbatim}
#include "Ifpack_Graph.h"
#include "Ifpack_Graph_Epetra_CrsGraph.h"
#include "Ifpack_Graph_Epetra_RowMatrix.h"

Epetra_CrsMatrix* CrsA;
Epetra_RowMatrix* RowA;

Ifpack_Graph CrsGraph* CrsGraph =
  new Ifpack_Graph_CrsGraph(&(CrsA->Graph()));

Ifpack_Graph RowGrap* RowGraph  =
  new Ifpack_Graph_RowMatrix(RowA);
\end{verbatim}
Note that the \verb!Partitioner! object will decompose the graph (either
\verb!CrsGraph! or \verb!RowGraph!) into
non-overlapping sets (that is, each graph vertex is assigned to exactly one
set).

The following fragment of code shows how to use a greedy partitioner to define
4 local blocks for a given \verb!Ifpack_Graph!.

\begin{verbatim}
#include "Ifpack_Graph.h"
#include "Ifpack_GreedyPartitioner.h"
#include "Ifpack_BlockJacobi.h"
#include "Teuchos_ParameterList.hpp"
...

Ifpack_Graph* Graph;   
// Graph is created here

Teuchos::ParameterList List;
List.set("partitioner: local blocks", 4);
Ifpack_Partitioner Partitioner = new Ifpack_GreedyPartitioner(Graph);

// set the parameters (in this case the # of blocks only)
Partitioner->SetParameters(List);

// compute the partition
Partitioner->Compute();
\end{verbatim}

The list of parameters accepted by \verb!Ifpack_Partitioner! objects is
reported below.

\smallskip

\choicebox{\tt partitioner: local blocks}{[{\tt int}] Number of local blocks.
  Default: {\tt 1}.}

\choicebox{\tt partitioner: root node}{[{\tt int}] Root node, for greedy
  partitioners only. Default: {\tt 0}.}
\medskip

Once an \verb!Ifpack_Partitioner! is created, we are ready to
compute the block preconditioner. This requires the extraction of
all the diagonal bocks of equation (\ref{eq:D}). In \ifpack, the
user can choose to store the $A_{i,i}$ as dense matrices, or a sparse
matrices. In the former case, the inverse of each block is applied using
LAPACK\footnote{LAPACK is used to factorize the matrix, then each application
  of $A_{i,i}^{-1}$ results in a dense linear system solution.}. In the
  latter, the user can specify any valid \verb!Ifpack_Preconditioner!.

As an example, we now create a block Jacobi preconditioner for 
a given \verb!Epetra_RowMatrix!, say \verb!A!,
with damping parameter of 0.67, and 2 sweeps. Each diagonal block is stored as a dense
matrix.

\begin{verbatim}
#include "Ifpack_BlockJacobi.h"
#include "Ifpack_DenseContainer.h"
...

Ifpack_Partitioner* Partitioner;
// Partitioner is created here

Ifpack_Preconditioner* Prec =
  new Ifpack_BlockJacobi<Ifpack_DenseContainer>(A);

Teuchos::ParameterList List;
List.set("block: sweeps", 2);
List.set("block: damping parameter", 0.67);
Prec->SetParameters(List);
Prec->Compute();
\end{verbatim}
The previous example makes use of a dense containers to store
the diagonal blocks.
In \ifpack, a {\sl container} is an object that contains all the necessary
data to solve the linear system with any given $A_{i,i}$. 
\verb!Ifpack_DenseContainer! stores each $A_{i,i}$ as
\verb!Epetra_SerialDenseMatrix!. Alternatively, one can use 
\verb!Ipfack_SparseContainer! to store each block as an
\verb!Epetra_CrsMatrix!. Sparse containers are templated with an
\verb!Ifpack_Preconditioner!, so that the user can specify which \ifpack\
  preconditioner has to be used to apply the inverse of each sparse block.

The following fragment of code illustrates how to use the direct factorization
of Amesos (through class \verb!Ifpack_Amesos!) with sparse containers. The
preconditioner will be a block Gauss-Seidel one.

\begin{verbatim}
#include "Ifpack_GaussSeidel.h"
#include "Ifpack_SparseContainer.h"
#include "Ifpack_Amesos.h"
...

Ifpack_Partitioner* Partitioner;
// Partitioner is created here

Ifpack_Preconditioner* Prec =
  new Ifpack_BlockJacobi<Ifpack_SparseContainer<Ifpack_Amesos> >(A);

Teuchos::ParameterList List;
List.set("block: sweeps", 2);
Prec->SetParameters(List);
Prec->Compute();
\end{verbatim}

As {\sl any} \ifpack\ preconditioner can be used, one can also adopt, for
instance, a point Gauss-Seidel algorithm in each block:
\begin{verbatim}
Ifpack_Preconditioner* Prec =
  new Ifpack_BlockJacobi<Ifpack_SparseContainer<Ifpack_GaussSeidel> >(A);
\end{verbatim}

A call to \verb!SetParameters(List)! will set the parameters for the block
Jacobi preconditioner, and for all the point Gauss-Seidel preconditioners as
well.

\section{Incomplete Factorization Preconditioners}
\label{sec:ilu}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The aim of this section is to define concepts associated with incomplete
factorization methods and establish our notation. This section is not
supposed to be exhaustive, nor complete on this subject. The reader is
referred to the existing literature for a comprehensive presentation.

\medskip

A broad class of effective preconditioners is based on incomplete
factorization of the linear system matrix.  Such preconditioners are often
referred to as incomplete lower/upper (ILU) preconditioners.  
ILU preconditioning techniques lie between direct and
iterative methods and provide a balance between reliability and
numerical efficiency.  ILU preconditioners are constructed in the factored form
$P=\tilde{L} \tilde{U}$, with $\tilde{L}$ and $\tilde{U}$ being lower
and upper triangular matrices. Solving with $P$ involves two triangular
solutions.

ILU preconditioners are based on the observation
that, although most matrices $A$ admit an LU factorization $A=LU$, where $L$ is
(unit) lower triangular and $U$ is upper triangular, the factors $L$ and $U$ often
contain too many nonzero terms, making the cost of factorization too expensive in
time or memory use, or both.  One type of ILU preconditioner is ILU(0), which 
is defined as proceeding through the standard LU decomposition computations, but keeping 
only those terms in $\tilde{L}$ that correspond to nonzero terms in the lower
triangle of $A$ and similarly keeping only those terms in $\tilde{U}$ that 
correspond to nonzero terms in the upper triangle of $A$.  Although effective, in
some cases the accuracy of the ILU(0) may be insufficient to yield an
adequate rate of convergence. More accurate factorizations will differ
from ILU(0) by allowing some {\em fill-in}. The resulting class of
methods is called ILU($k$), where $k$ is the level-of-fill. A
level-of-fill is attributed to each element that is processed by
Gaussian elimination, and dropping will be based on the level-of-fill.
The level-of-fill should be indicative of the size of the element: the
higher the level-of-fill, the smaller the elements.  

Other strategies consider dropping by value -- for example, dropping
entries smaller than a prescribed threshold. Alternative dropping
techniques can be based on the numerical size of the element to be
discarded. Numerical dropping strategies generally yield more accurate
factorizations with the same amount of fill-in as level-of-fill
methods. The general strategy is to compute an entire row of the
$\tilde{L}$ and $\tilde{U}$ matrices, and then keep only a certain
number of the largest
entries. In this way, the amount of fill-in is
controlled; however, the structure of the resulting matrices is
undefined. These factorizations are usually referred to as ILUT, and a
variant which performs pivoting is called ILUTP.  

When solving a single linear system, ILUT methods can be more effective
than ILU($k$).  However, in many situations a sequence of linear systems
must be solved where the pattern of the matrix $A$ in each system is
identical but the values of changed.  In these situations, ILU($k$) is 
typically much more effective because the pattern of ILU($k$) will also
be the same for each linear system and the overhead of computing the
pattern is amortized.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Incomplete Cholesky Factorizations}
\label{sec:ifpack_chol}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recall that if a matrix is symmetric positive definite, it admits a Cholesky
factorization of the form $A=LL^T$, where $L$ is lower triangular.
Ifpack\_CrsIct is a class for constructing and using incomplete Cholesky
factorizations of an Epetra\_CrsMatrix. It is built in part on top of the ICT
preconditioner developed by Edmond Chow at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory~\cite{ChowICT}.  Specific factorizations depend on several parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item Maximum number of entries per row/column. The factorization
  will contain at most this number of nonzero elements in each
  row/column;
\item Diagonal perturbation.  By default, the factorization will be
  computed on the input matrix. However, it is possible to modify the
  diagonal entries of the matrix to be factorized, via functions
  \verb!SetAbsoluteThreshold()! and \verb!SetRelativeThreshold()!. Refer
  to the IFPACK's documentation for more details.
\end{itemize}

It is easy to have IFPACK compute the incomplete factorization. First, define
an Ifpack\_CrsIct object,
\begin{verbatim}
Ifpack_CrsIct * ICT = NULL;
ICT = Ifpack_CrsIct(A,DropTol,LevelFill);
\end{verbatim}
where \verb!A! is an Epetra\_CrsMatrix (already FillComplete'd), and
\verb!DropTop! and \verb!LevelFill! are the drop tolerance and the
level-of-fill, respectively. Then, we can set the values and compute the
factors,
\begin{verbatim}
ICT->InitValues(A);
ICT->Factor();
\end{verbatim}

IFPACK can compute the estimation of the condition number
\[
cond(L_i U_i) \approx \|(LU)^{-1} e \|_\infty ,
\]
where $e = (1,1,\dots,1)^T$. (More details can be found in the IFPACK
documentation.) This estimation can be computed as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
double Condest;
ICT->Condest(false,Condest);
\end{verbatim}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{RILUK  Factorizations}
\label{sec:ifpack_rilu}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

IFPACK implements various incomplete factorization for non-symmetric
matrices. In this Section, we will consider the Epetra\_CrsRiluk class,
that can be used to produce RILU factorization of a Epetra\_CrsMatrix.
The class required an Ifpack\_OverlapGraph in the construction phase.
This means that the factorization is split into two parts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Definition of the level filled graph;
\item Computation of the factors.
\end{enumerate}
This approach can significantly improve the performances of code, when
an ILU preconditioner has to be computed for several matrices, with
different entries but with the same sparsity pattern. An
Ifpack\_IlukGraph object of an Epetra matrix \verb!A! can be constructed
as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
Ifpack_IlukGraph Graph = 
  Ifpack_IlukGraph(A.Graph(),LevelFill,LevelOverlap);
\end{verbatim}
Here, \verb!LevelOverlap! is the required overlap among the subdomains.

A call to \verb!ConstructFilledGraph()! completes the process.

\begin{remark}
  An Ifpack\_IlukGraph object has two Epetra\_CrsGraph objects,
  containing the $L_i$ and $U_i$ graphs. Thus, it is possible to
  manually insert and delete graph entries in $L_i$ and $U_i$ via the
  Epetra\_CrsGraphInsertIndices and RemoveIndices functions. However, in
  this case FillComplete must be called before the graph is used for
  subsequent operations.
\end{remark}

At this point, we can create an Ifpack\_CrsRiluk object,
\begin{verbatim}
ILUK = Ifpack_CrsRiluk(Graph);
\end{verbatim}
This phase defined the graph for the incomplete factorization, without
computing the actual values of the $L_i$ and $U_i$ factors. Instead,
this operation is accomplished with
\begin{verbatim}
int initerr = ILUK->InitValues(A);
\end{verbatim}
The ILUK object can be used with AztecOO simply setting
\begin{verbatim}
solver.SetPrecOperator(ILUK);
\end{verbatim}
where \verb!solver! is an AztecOO object.
\smallskip

\medskip

The application of the incomplete factors to a global vector, $z =
(L_iU_i^{-1}) r$, results in redundant approximation for any element of
$z$ that correspond to rows that are part of more than one local ILU
factor. The OverlapMode defines how those redundant values are managed.
OverlapMode is an Epetra\_CombinedMode enum, that can assume the
following values: {\tt Add, Zero, Insert, Average, AbxMax}. The default
is to zero out all the values of $z$ for rows that were not part of the
original matrix row distribution.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Additive Schwarz Preconditioners}
\label{sec:additive}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\ifpack\ makes very easy to define and use domain decomposition
preconditioners of (overlapping) Schwarz type.

The basic idea of DD methods is to decompose the
computational domain $\Omega$ into $M$ smaller parts $\Omega_i$,
$i=1,\ldots,M$, called subdomains, such that $\cup_{i=1}^{M}
\overline{\Omega_i} = \overline{\Omega}$.  Next, the original problem can
be reformulated within each subdomain $\Omega_i$, of smaller size. This
family of subproblems is coupled one to another through the values of the
unknown solution at subdomain interface. This coupling is then removed at
the expense of introducing an iterative process which involves, at each
step, solutions on the $\Omega_i$ with additional interface conditions on
$\partial \Omega_i \setminus \partial \Omega$.

In overlapping Schwarz preconditioner, the computational domain is
subdivided into {\sl overlapping} subdomains, and local Dirichlet-type
problems are then solved on each subdomain.  The communication between the
solutions on the different subdomains is here guaranteed by the overlapping
region. More details can be found, for instance, in books
\cite{QV} and~\cite{smith96parallel}.

\ifpack supports two major cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item Minimal-overlap (here referred to as "zero-overlap"): each subdomain
is identified by the set of local rows of the preconditioned matrix;
\item General overlap: each subdomain is identified by the set of local rows
of a suitable overlapping matrix.
\end{itemize}
In both cases, each processor is reponsible for exactly one subdomain.

The additive Schwarz preconditioner can be written as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:as}
P_{AS}^{-1} = \sum_{i=1}^M R_i^T A_i^{-1} R_i ,
\end{equation}
where $M$ is the number of subdomains (that is, the number of processors in
the computation), $R_i$ is an operator that restricts the global 
vector to the vector lying on subdomain $i$, and
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Ai}
A_i = R_i A R_i^T.
\end{equation}

In the minimal overlap case, the $R_i$'s are not implemented, since the
required components of the residual vector are already local. If a wider overlap
is used, instead, each application of $R_i$ requires the importing of
off-process data, and each application of $R_i^T$ the exporting of local data.

Besides, in the minimal overlap case, (\ref{eq:Ai}) can simply obtained from
the local rows of $A$, by dropping all nonzeros corresponding to non-local
columns. Wider overlaps, instead, involve importing of non-local rows, to
explicitly form the overlapping matrix.

\smallskip

Once matrices (\ref{eq:Ai}) have been formed, the user still need to define a
strategy to apply the inverse of $A_i$ in (\ref{eq:as}). At this purpose,
any \ifpack\ preconditioner can be adopted. Common choices can be:
\begin{itemize}
\item To solve exactly on each subdomain, using the \verb!Ifpack_Amesos!
preconditioner. This is shown in Section~\ref{sec:as_amesos}.
\item To solve using an inexact LU factorization, as presented in
Section~\ref{sec:as_ilu}.
\item To furtherly decompose the local domain into smaller subdomains,
  then apply a block Jacobi or block Gauss-Seidel preconditioner. This is
  outlined in Section~\ref{sec:as_b_ov}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{remark}
Additive Schwarz preconditioners as reported in equation~(\ref{eq:as}) 
are not scalable: their convergence rate
deteriorates as the number of subdomains (that is, of the processors)
increases. Algebraic techniques
exist to improve the performances of~(\ref{eq:as}); 
see for example the documentation of the ML
package~\cite{ml-guide}.
\end{remark}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Additive Schwarz with Exact Local Solves}
\label{sec:as_amesos}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following fragment of code shows the use of additive preconditioners. Each
submatrix is solved using \amesos\ for the entire block.
\begin{verbatim}
#include "Ifpack_AdditiveSchwarz.h"
#include "Ifpack_Amesos.h"

Epetra_RowMatrix* A;
// Here the elements of A are filled, and FillComplete() is called.

Ifpack_Preconditioner Prec = 
  new Ifpack_AdditiveSchwarz<Ifpack_Amesos>(A);

Teuchos::ParameterList List;
IFPACK_CHK_ERR(Prec->SetParameters(List));
IFPACK_CHK_ERR(Prec->Compute());
\end{verbatim}

To use a wider overlap, the user can provide two \verb!Epetra_RowMatrix!'s to the
\verb!Ifpack_AdditiveSchwarz! constructor: one will be the matrix to be
preconditioned, and the other the matrix whose local graph defining
(\ref{eq:Ai}).
For example, let us say that \verb!A! is the linear system matrix (to be
preconditioned), and \verb!OverlappingA! is the user's defined overlapping
matrix. Then, the preconditioner can be constructed by
\begin{verbatim}
Ifpack_Preconditioner* Prec = 
  new Ifpack_AdditiveSchwarz<Ifpack_Amesos>(A,OverlappingA);
\end{verbatim}
\hspace*{1cm}
followed by, as usual, by
\begin{verbatim}
IFPACK_CHK_ERR(Prec->SetParameters(List));
IFPACK_CHK_ERR(Prec->Compute());
\end{verbatim}

This preconditioner will use \amesos's factorization to apply the inverse of
the local matrix of \verb!OverlappingA!.

\smallskip

Alternatively, class \verb!Ifpack_CrsAdditiveSchwarz! 
enables the definition of additive
Schwarz preconditioner with generic amount of overap. The class requires a
\verb!Epetra_CrsMatrix! in input, plus the desired level of
overlap\footnote{We recall again that minimal overlap is defined as `0' overlap.}. 

Figure~\ref{fig:uml_additive} reports the inheritance and collaboration
diagram of class \verb!Ifpack_CrsAdditiveSchwarz!.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5cm,height=4cm]{CrsAdditiveSchwarz_Inheritance.eps}
\hspace*{1cm}
\includegraphics[width=7cm,height=4cm]{CrsAdditiveSchwarz_Collaboration.eps}
\caption{Inheritance (left) and collaboration (right) diagram of class
  {\tt Ifpack\_CrsAdditiveSchwarz}.}
  \label{fig:uml_additive}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The following code reports an example of use.
\begin{verbatim}
int OverlapLevel = 2;
Teuchos::ParameterList List;
List.set("partitioner: overlap level", OverlapLevel);

Epetra_CrsMatrix* CrsA; // CrsA is FillComplete()'d.

Ifpack_Preconditioner* Prec =
  new Ifpack_CrsAdditiveSchwarz<Ifpack_Amesos>(CrsA,OverlapLevel);

  IFPACK_CHK_ERR(Prec->SetParameters(List));
  IFPACK_CHK_ERR(Prec->Compute());
\end{verbatim}

Note that \verb~partitioner: overlap level~ refers to the overlap among the
{\sl blocks}, while \verb~OverlapLevel~ to the overlap among the subdomains.
These two parameters can differ.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Additive Schwarz with Inexact Local Solves}
\label{sec:as_ilu}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Parallel direct sparse solvers that compute the complete factorization $A=LU$
are effective on parallel computers.  However, the effective scalability
of these solvers is typically limited to a speedup of order ten, regardless
of the number of processors used.  Also, it is typically the factorization
(constructing $L$ and $U$) that exhibits the best parallel speedup.  The 
forward and back triangular solves typically exhibit very poor parallel speedup.

The situation for ILU preconditioners is even worse.  Complete factorizations
can scale well because of very important graph properties that can be determined
at low cost.  ILU factorizations do not have the same properties, so predicting
fill-in across the parallel machine is not practically possible.  Also, because ILU
preconditioners require repeated forward and back solves, they are more affected
by the poor scalability of these operations.

Because ILU preconditioners do not scale well on parallel computers, a common
practice is to perform {\em local} ILU factorizations.  In this situation, each
processor computes a factorization of a subset of matrix rows and columns independently
from all other processors.  This additional layer of approximation leads to a block
Jacobi type of preconditioner across processors, where each block is solved using an
ILU preconditioner.  The difficulty with this type of preconditioner is that it 
tends to become less robust and require more iterations as the number of processors used
increases.  This effect can be offset to some extent by allowing {\em overlap}.  Overlap
refers to having processors redundantly own certain rows of the matrix for the ILU
factorization.  Level-1 overlap is defined so that a processor will include rows that
are part of its original set.  In addition, if row $i$ is part of its original set and 
row $i$ of $A$ has a nonzero entry in column $j$, then row $j$ will also
be included in the factorization on that processor.  Other levels of overlap are
computed recursively.  IFPACK supports an arbitrary level of overlap.  However,
level-1 is often most effective.  Seldom more than 3 levels are needed. 


%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Additive Schwarz with Local Block Preconditioners}
\label{sec:as_b_ov}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another possible technique to apply the inverse of $A_i$ in (\ref{eq:as})
is to adopt a block preconditioner, like block Jacobi 
or block Gauss-Seidel (see
Section~\ref{sec:block}). This requires a
bit more work, as we have to specify the partitioner, and the container. Let
us start with dense containers.

The required include files are:
\begin{verbatim}
#include "Ifpack_AdditiveSchwarz.h"
#include "Ifpack_BlockPreconditioner.h"
#include "Ifpack_Graph_Epetra_RowMatrix.h"
#include "Ifpack_DenseContainer.h"
\end{verbatim}

Let \verb!A! be an \verb!Epetra_RowMatrix!. We suppose that
\verb!FillComplete()! has been called. 

As always, we create a parameters list, that will be used
for all \ifpack\ objects:
\begin{verbatim}
Teuchos::ParameterList List;
\end{verbatim}
As we wish to use a block Jacobi method to solve the {\sl local} problems, we
need to create a graph, and then a partitioner:
\begin{verbatim}
Ifpack_Graph* Graph = 
  new Ifpack_Graph_Epetra_RowMatrix(A);

Ifpack_Partitioner* Partitioner = 
  new Ifpack_METISPartitioner(Graph);

IFPACK_CHK_ERR(Partitioner->SetParameters(List));
IFPACK_CHK_ERR(Partitioner->Compute());
\end{verbatim}
The partitioner object has to be stored in the list:
\begin{verbatim}
List.set("block: partitioner object", &Partitioner);
\end{verbatim}
At this point we can create the block Jacobi preconditioner as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
Ifpack_Preconditioner Prec = 
  new Ifpack_AdditiveSchwarz<Ifpack_BlockJacobi<Ifpack_DenseContainer> >(A);

Prec->SetParameters(List);
Prec->Compute();
\end{verbatim}

Sparse containers can be used with minor modifications. The only difference is
that we also have to specify how to apply the inverse of each block, for
instance using the exact factorizations of \amesos:
\begin{verbatim}
Ifpack_Preconditioner Prec = 
  new Ifpack_AdditiveSchwarz<Ifpack_BlockJacobi
    <Ifpack_SparseContainer<Ifpack_Amesos> > >(A);
\end{verbatim}



Should the user want to use a block Gauss-Seidel preconditioner (where each
block is defined by partitioning the local graph of the overlapping matrix),
he/she could proceed as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
Teuchos::ParameterList List;
List.set("block: damping factor", .67);
List.set("block: sweeps",5);
List.set("block: local blocks", 4);
List.set("block: overlap level", OverlapLevel);
List.set("block: print level", 0);

Epetra_CrsMatrix* CrsA; // CrsA is FillComplete()'d.

Ifpack_Preconditioner* Prec =
  new Ifpack_CrsAdditiveSchwarz<Ifpack_BlockJacobi
      <Ifpack_SparseContainer<Ifpack_Amesos> > >(CrsA,OverlapLevel);

IFPACK_CHK_ERR(Prec->SetParameters(List));
IFPACK_CHK_ERR(Prec->Compute());
\end{verbatim}

\bigskip

Preconditioners of Section~\ref{sec:block} are defined on minimal overlapping
partitions. Indeed, \ifpack\ block preconditioners can be defined in more
general terms. The block preconditioners of \ifpack\ 
allow two kinds of overlap:
\begin{itemize}
\item Overlap among the processors (subdomains);
\item Overlap among the blocks, within the local graph.
\end{itemize}
The first overlap can be handled by \verb!Ifpack_AdditiveSchwarz! (and
derived) classes. The second one is handled by \verb!Ifpack_Partitioner!
objects.

To fix the notation, let us suppose to partition the set of (local) rows of 
the (overlapping) matrix into $m$ sets $S_i, i=1, \ldots,m$, such that
\[
S_i \subseteq S, \quad \cup_i S_i = S.
\]
Let $V_i$ be a
boolean $n \times n_i$ matrix (where $n_i = card(S_i)$), whose entries are
defined as
\[
V_{i,j} = \left\{
\begin{array}{l l}
1 & \mbox{ if } i \in S_j \\
  0 & \mbox{otherwise}
\end{array}
  \right.
\]
A general block Jacobi iteration can be defined as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
&& \mbox{On each processor, for each block $i$, Do} \\
&& \label{eq:gen_b_jacobi}
x^{(k)} = x^{(k-1)} + V_i^T A_{i,i}^{-1} V_i(b - A x^{(k-1)}.
\end{eqnarray}
In Equation (\ref{eq:gen_b_jacobi}), it is understood that the $x$ vectors
refer to the local components.
Figure~\ref{fig:bj} graphically describes the block Jacobi with variable
overlap among blocks.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=6cm]{bj.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{THe block Jacobi matrix with overlapping blocks.}
\label{fig:bj}
\end{figure}

The block Gauss-Seidel algorithm easily derives from
(\ref{eq:gen_b_jacobi}), by immediately updating the solution vector to
compute the residual. The algorithm is as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
&& \mbox{On each processor, for each block $i$, Do} \\
&& \label{eq:gen_b_gs}
x^{(k)} = x^{(k-1)} + V_i^T A_{i,i}^{-1} V_i(b - A x^{(k)}.
\end{eqnarray}

\section{Building \ifpack}
\label{sec:config}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

We recommend to configure and build \ifpack\ as part of the standard 
\trilinos~build and configure process.  In fact,
\ifpack\ is built by default if you follow the standard \trilinos~configure
and build directions. Please refer to the \trilinos~documentation 
for information about the configuration and building of
other \trilinos~packages.

\smallskip

To configure and build \ifpack\ through \trilinos, you may need do the
following (actual configuration options may vary depending on the
specific architecture, installation, and user's need).  It's assumed
that shell variable \verb!$TRILINOS_HOME!  identifies the
\trilinos~directory, and, for example, that we are compiling under LINUX
and MPI.
\begin{verbatim}
% cd $TRILINOS_HOME
% mkdir LINUX_MPI
% cd LINUX_MPI
% $TRILINOS_HOME/configure  --with-mpi-compilers \
    --prefix=$TRILINOS_HOME/LINUX_MPI
% make
% make install
\end{verbatim}

\ifpack\ is configured and built using the GNU autoconf~\cite{Autoconf} and
automake~\cite{Automake} tools. 
\ifpack configuration and compilation can be tuned by several flags.
The user may type 
\begin{verbatim}
% configure --help
\end{verbatim}
in the \ifpack source directory for a complete list. Here, we briefly report
the list of packages (included or not in Trilinos) that are supported 
by \ifpack:

\medskip

\choicebox{\tt --enable-amesos}
{Enables support for the \amesos~package, which can be used to solve the
  local subproblems in Schwarz-type preconditioners, or in
    block Jacobi and block Gauss-Seidel preconditioners.}

\choicebox{\tt --enable-aztecoo}
{Enable support for the \aztecoo\ package. \aztecoo~is used in several tests
  and examples.}

\choicebox{\tt --enable-teuchos}
{Enable support for the \teuchos\ package, whose parameters list is used by
  several \ifpack\ classes.}

\choicebox{\tt --enable-triutils}
{Enable support for the \triutils\ package, which is used in some examples and
  test to generate the linear system.}

\choicebox{\tt --enable-ifpack-metis}
{Enable support for the \metis\ package, version 4.0 or later. \metis\ can be
  used to create block preconditioners.}

\begin{remark}
\ifpack\ cannot be compiled without the \epetra\ library.
\end{remark}
