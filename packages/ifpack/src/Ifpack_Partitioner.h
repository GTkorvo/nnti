//! Ifpack_Partitioner: A class to decompose overlapping and non-overlapping Ifpack_Graph's.

/*!
 
  FIXME:

  Class Ifpack_Partitioner enables the decomposition of Ifpack_Graph's.
  The constructor of Ifpack_Partitioner requires one graph (\c G).
  Only the \e local graph will be partitioned, and all intra-process
  edges will be ignored.
  
  Ifpack_Partitioner operates as follows:
  - \c G will be decomposed into the specified number of parts. 
    Only the local subgraph of G is partitioned. The overloaded operator
    (int i) can be used to extract the local partition ID of local row i.
    Partitions are non-overlapping (in graph sense), as each row of \c G
    is included in exactly one partition.
  - If required, the non-overlapping partitions can be extended, so that
    they share an overlap (\c OverlapLevel). Overlapping partitions
    are created from the same graph \c G, hence the overlap will be
    created in the local graph only. Overlapping partitions are
    created by derived class Ifpack_OverlappingPartitioner.

  Ifpack_Partitioner requires an Ifpack_Graph object. Concrete classes
  are provided, to create Ifpack_Graph's as light-weight conversions
  from Epetra_CrsGraph's, and Epetra_CrsMatrix's.
  
  An example of use is a follows:  
  \code
#include "Ifpack_Partitioner.h"
#include "Ifpack_Graph.h"
#include "Ifpack_GraphEpetraCrs.h"
...
Epetra_CrsMatrix* A;         // A is filled
Ifpack_Graph Graph = new Ifpack_GraphEpetraCrs(A);

// we aim to create non-overlapping partitions only
Ifpack_Partitioner Partitioner(Graph);

Teuchos::ParameterList List;
List.set("partitioner: type", "linear");     // linear decomposition
List.set("partitioner: overlap", 0);   // no overlap (default)

Partitioner.Create(List);              // decompose the graph;
delete Graph;                          // now Graph can be delete

int NumParts = Partitioner.NumParts(); // parts actually created

for (int i = 0 ; i < NumParts ; ++i) { // gets the rows in each part
  cout << "rows in " << i << "=" << Partitioner.RowsInPart(i);
}  

// get the partition ID for each local row
for (int i = 0 ; i < A->NumMyRows() ; ++i)
cout << "Partition[" << i <<"] = " << Partitioner(i) << endl;

\endcode
  
When overlapping partitiones are created, the user can get the 
row ID contained in each partition as follows:
\code
for (int i = 0 ; i < NumParts ; ++i) {
  for (int j = 0 ; j < Partitioner.RowsInPart(i) ; ++j) {
    cout << "Partition " << i << ", contains local row "
         << Partitioner(i,j) << endl;
  }
}  
\endcode
  
Ifpack_Partitioner is used to create the subblocks in Ifpack_BlockJacobi,
Ifpack_OverlappingBlockJacobi, Ifpack_GaussSeidel, 
Ifpack_OverlappingGaussSeidel. 

\note Partition ID's are local with respect to the numbering of \c G.
