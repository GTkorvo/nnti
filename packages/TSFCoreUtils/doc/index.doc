/*! \mainpage TSFCoreUtils : Utilities and other software foundational to TSFCore

Much of this software was extracted from MOOCHO and put into Trilinos
to support TSFCore (which originally was also in MOOCHO).  This
package contains somewhat of a mixed bag of software.  The source
directory is broken up into three subdirectories; MoochoMoreUtilities,
RTOpPack and RTOpStdOps.  By far the most significant part of this
package is RTOp.
