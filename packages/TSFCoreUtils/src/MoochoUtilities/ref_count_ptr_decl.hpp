/** @defgroup ref_count_ptr_stuff Reference counting smart pointer class for  automatic garbage collection.
 * \ingroup Misc_grp
 *
 * Described here is a template class (MemMngPack::ref_count_ptr<tt><...></tt>) and a set of template
 * functions for implementing automatic garbage collection in C++ using smart reference counted pointers.
 * This design is based partly on the interface for <tt>std::auto_ptr<T></tt> and
 * Items 28 and 29 in "More Effective C++" by Scott Myers.  In short,
 * using this class allows one client to dynamically create an object (using new),
 * pass it around to bunch of other clients which also need it and
 * then never requiring any client to explicitly call delete but the object
 * will still (almost magically) be deleted when everyone is finished using it.
 * Boy, doesn't this sound like garbage collection like is implimented
 * in Perl and Java.  However, to realize this wonderful behavior requires
 * following some rules.  These rules will be spelled out later.
 *
 * The following class hierarchy will be used to demonstrate this smart pointer design.
 \code

 class A { public: virtual ~A() {} A& operator=(const A&) {} virtual void f() {} };
 class B1 : virtual public A {};
 class B2 : virtual public A {};
 class C : virtual public B1, virtual public B2 {};
 class D {};
 class E : public D {};
 \endcode
 * Note that the classes <tt>A</tt>, <tt>B1</tt>, <tt>B2</tt> and <tt>C</tt> are polymorphic (with
 * multiple inheritance with virtual base classes to boot) while the classes <tt>D</tt> and <tt>E</tt> are not.  
 *
 * In the following description, all of the code examples are written as though there was a 
 * <tt>using namespace %MemMngPack;</tt> declaration is the current scope.
 *
 * A smart reference counted pointer to a dynammicallly allocated object of type <tt>A</tt> is initialized like:
 \code

 ref_count_ptr<A>             a_ptr   = rcp(new A);    // i.e. A       *       a_ptr   = new A;
 ref_count_ptr<const A>       ca_ptr  = rcp(new A);    // i.e. const A *       ca_ptr  = new A;
 const ref_count_ptr<A>       a_cptr  = rcp(new A);    // i.e. A       * const a_cptr  = new A;
 const ref_count_ptr<const A> ca_cptr = rcp(new A);    // i.e. const A * const ca_cptr = new A;
 \endcode
 * The above code shows how all the various combinations for const or non-const pointers
 * to const or non-const objects are expressed.  There is no automatic conversion from
 * raw pointers to smart pointers for many good reasons.  To allow such an implicit
 * conversion almost guarentees memory allocation/deallocation errors will occur.
 * Therefore, the templated function \c rcp<T>(T* p) must be used to initialize a smart
 * pointer (with one exception explained below for initializing to \c NULL).
 * Through the magic of the member functions \c operator->() and \c operator*(), these referenced
 * objects can be accessed exactly the same as for raw pointers like:
 \code

 a_ptr->f();
 (*a_ptr).f();
 \endcode
 * Therefore, using a smart reference counted pointer is very similar to
 * using a raw C++ pointer.  Some things you can do with smart reference countered
 * pointers that are similar as for raw pointers are:
 \code

 ref_count_ptr<A>
   a_ptr1     = rcp(new A),   // Initialize them from a raw pointer from new
   a_ptr2     = rcp(new A);   // ""
 A *ra_ptr1   = new A,        // ""
   *ra_ptr2   = new A;        // ""
 a_ptr1       = rcp(ra_ptr2); // Assign from a raw pointer (only do this once!)
 a_ptr2       = a_ptr1;       // Assign one smart pointer to another
 a_ptr1       = rcp(ra_ptr1); // Assign from a raw pointer (only do this once!)
 a_ptr1->f();                 // Access a member using ->
 ra_ptr1->f();                // ""
 *a_ptr1      = *a_ptr2;      // Dereference the objects and assign
 *ra_ptr1     = *ra_ptr2;     // "" 
 \endcode
 * What makes smart pointers different however is that the above piece of code
 * does not create any memory leaks that would have otherwise been the case
 * if <tt>a_ptr1</tt> and <tt>a_ptr2</tt> where raw C++ pointers.
 * However, these smart reference counted pointers can not be used everywhere a
 * raw pointer can be.  For instance the following statements will not compile:
 \code

 a_ptr1++;           // Error, pointer arithmetic ++, --, +, - etc. not defined!
 a_ptr1 == ra_ptr1;  // Error, comparision operators ==, !=, <=, >= etc. not defined!
 \endcode
 * Since a smart reference counted pointer can not be used everywhere a raw C++ pointer
 * can be, there is a means for getting at the raw C++ pointer with the <tt>get()</tt> function
 * (same as with \c std::auto_ptr<T>::get()).  For example, to check if two smart pointer
 * objects contain references to the same object you would check:
 \code

 if( a_ptr1.get() == a_ptr2.get() )
   std::cout << "a_ptr1 and a_ptr2 point to the same object\n";
 \endcode
 * 
 * The conversion of smart pointers according to inheritance is just as easy
 * as with raw C++ pointers if member templates are supported.  This option is already
 * supported but must be enabled by defining the preprocessor macro
 * \c REF_COUNT_PTR_TEMPLATE_CLASS_TEMPLATE_FUNCTIONS.  For raw C++ pointers, the compiler will
 * implicitly cast up an inheritance hiearchy (i.e. <tt>*B1 => *A</tt> or <tt>*E => *D</tt>).
 * For smart reference counted pointers with member template functions supported, this is just
 * as easy.  For example, the below code compiles and runs just fine:
 \code

 ref_count_ptr<C>  c_ptr  = rcp(new C);
 ref_count_ptr<A>  a_ptr  = c_ptr;
 ref_count_ptr<B1> b1_ptr = c_ptr;
 ref_count_ptr<D>  d_ptr  = rcp(new E);
 \endcode
 * If member template functions are not supported (and the macro
 * \c REF_COUNT_PTR_TEMPLATE_CLASS_TEMPLATE_FUNCTIONS is not defined)
 * the conversion of smart pointers according to inheritance is not so
 * nice as with raw C++ pointers.  To accomplish casts that the C++
 * compiler would perform for you, you must use the following non-member template function:
 \code

 template<class T2, class T1>
 ref_count_ptr<T2> rcp_implicit_cast(const ref_count_ptr<T1>& p1);
 \endcode
 * The above code without member template functons would have to be written like:
 \code

 ref_count_ptr<C>  c_ptr  = rcp(new C);
 ref_count_ptr<A>  a_ptr  = rcp_implicit_cast<A>(c_ptr);
 ref_count_ptr<B1> b1_ptr = rcp_implicit_cast<B1>(c_ptr);
 ref_count_ptr<D>  d_ptr  = rcp_implicit_cast<D>(rcp(new E));
 \endcode
 * Okay, so having to use <tt>rcp_implicit_cast<...></tt> to explicitly perform all casts
 * that should be performed implicitly is a pain, but if your compiler does not support
 * member template functions then you have no choice.
 *
 * To perform other non-implicit type conversions with pointers such as
 * <tt>static_cast<...></tt>, <tt>const_cast<...></tt> and <tt>dynamic_cast<...></tt> there are
 * corresponding non-member template functions \c rcp_static_cast(), \c rcp_const_cast() and
 * \c rcp_dynamic_cast() respectively with the following prototypes:
 \code

 template<class T2, class T1>
 ref_count_ptr<T2> rcp_static_cast(const ref_count_ptr<T1>& p1);

 template<class T2, class T1>
 ref_count_ptr<T2> rcp_const_cast(const ref_count_ptr<T1>& p1);

 template<class T2, class T1>
 ref_count_ptr<T2> rcp_dynamic_cast(const ref_count_ptr<T1>& p1);
 \endcode
 * The usage of these conversion template functions looks very similar to the
 * syntax with raw C++ pointers.  For example:
 \code

 ref_count_ptr<const C>   c_ptr   = rcp(new C);
 ref_count_ptr<const A>   ca_ptr  = c_ptr;
 ref_count_ptr<const C>   cc_ptr1 = rcp_dynamic_cast<const C>(ca_ptr);  // Safe and checked at runtime!
 ref_count_ptr<const C>   cc_ptr2 = rcp_static_cast<const C>(ca_ptr);   // Potentially unsafe and unchecked!
 ref_count_ptr<A>         a_ptr   = rcp_const_cast<A>(ca_ptr);          // Cast away const
 \endcode
 * Just as with the case with the built-in C++ conversion operators, some types
 * of conversions will not compile.  For example:
 \code

 ref_count_ptr<C>          c_ptr1 = rcp(new C);
 ref_count_ptr<A>          a_ptr  = c_ptr;
 ref_count_ptr<const C>    c_ptr2 = rcp_dynamic_cast<const C>(a_ptr);  // Error, can't const and dyn cast at same time!
 ref_count_ptr<const C>    c_ptr3 = rcp_dynamic_cast<const C>(
                                        const_cast<const A>(a_ptr)
                                      );                               // Okay
 ref_count_ptr<D>          d_ptr  = rcp(new D);
 ref_count_ptr<E>          e_ptr1 = rcp_dynamic_cast<E>(d_ptr);        // Error, D and E are not polymorphic!
 ref_count_ptr<E>          e_ptr2 = rcp_static_cast<E>(d_ptr);         // Okay?
 \endcode
 * There are a few rules that you must absolutly follow when using
 * <tt>ref_count_ptr<...></tt> objects:
 *
 * 1) Never give a raw pointer to more than one <tt>ref_count_ptr<...></tt> object.
 * If you do you must call release on all but one of them or multiple calls
 * to delete will be performed and result in a runtime error.
 \code

 {
   C  *rc_ptr = new C;
   ...
   ref_count_ptr<C> c_ptr1 = rcp(rc_ptr); // c_ptr1 has ownership to delete!
   ...
   ref_count_ptr<C> c_ptr2 = rcp(rc_ptr); // c_ptr2 knows nothing of c_ptr1 but assumes has ownership to delete!
   ...
   // At end of block when c_ptr2 is destroyed, delete on rc_ptr will be called
   // then delete will be called again when c_ptr1 is destroyed!  This is
   // a runtime error that may crash the program.
 }
 \endcode
 *
 * 2) When sharing objects from polymorphic classes using multiple inheritance,
 * always make the first ref_count_ptr<> object have the same type used with
 * \c new.
 \code

 {
   C*                rc_ptr1 = new C;
   ref_count_ptr<B1> b1_ptr1(rc_ptr1); // Bad! (void*)b1_ptr1.get() != (void*)rc_ptr1 in general!
   C*                rc_ptr2 = new C;
   ref_count_ptr<B1> b1_ptr2 = rcp(rc_ptr2); // Okay! rcp() will create a ref_count_ptr<C> object
   // When delete is called on the internal shared pointer in the destructor for b1_ptr2,
   // the address (void*)rc_ptr2 will be used which is the same that was returned from new.
   // However, when delete is called on the internal shared pointer in the destructor
   // for b1_ptr1 the address (void*)(B1*)rc_ptr1 will be used which in general may not
   // be the same as (void*)rc_ptr2 which was returned from new.  Most C++ implementations
   // will (incorrectly) just call free() after the destructor is called which will yield
   // a runtime error since this not the same address returned from malloc().
 }
 \endcode
 * The above detail is very tricky but if you follow the guidelines below this will not
 * come up to bite you.
 *
 * 3) Always perform conversions using the non-member template functions described
 * above.  Never, and I mean never, perform a conversion using
 * \c MemMngPack::ref_count_ptr::get().
 \code

 {
   ref_count_ptr<C> c_ptr = rcp(new C);       // c_ptr has ownership to detete
   ...
   ref_count_ptr<A> a_ptr = rcp(c_ptr.get()); // This performs the conversion but
                                              // a_ptr knowns nothing of c_ptr.
    ...
	// At end of block when a_ptr is destroyed, delete will be called
	// then delete will be called again when c_ptr is destroyed!  This is
	// a runtime error that may crash the program.
 }
 \endcode
 * The above example is very similar to 1) in that two <tt>ref_count_ptr<...></tt>
 * objects have ownership to delete a dynamically allocated object but do
 * know of the other <tt>ref_count_ptr<...></tt> object.  Therefore when these
 * smart pointer objects are deleted they don't know that any other clients
 * still needed it so that it will not delete the object.
 *
 * 4) Never give any <tt>ref_count_ptr<...></tt> objects the pointer to a static
 * (i.e. global) or automatic (i.e. created on the stack) object without
 * passing <tt>has_ownership==false</tt> to the constructor
 * MemMngPack::ref_count_ptr::ref_count_ptr<tt>(p,has_ownership)</tt>
 * or calling calling MemMngPack::ref_count_ptr::release() immediatly after.
 * If you don't, then <tt>delete</tt> will be called on this pointer and cause a memory
 * coruption at runtime.
 \code

 {
   C c1; // Allocated by the compiler on the stack (not dynamically allocated!)
   C c2; // ""
   ...
   ref_count_ptr<C> c1_ptr = &c1;      // Oh no! c1_ptr has ownership to delete!
   ref_count_ptr<C> c2_ptr(&c2,false); // Okay! will not try to delete c2!
   ...
   // At the end of the block when c1_ptr is destroyed delete will be called
   // on &c1 even through it was not allocated with new.  This is a runtime
   // error that will probably crash the program.  However, when c2_ptr is destroyed
   // nothing (bad) will happen.
 }
 \endcode
 *
 * 5) Never give a raw C++ pointer returned from <tt>ref_count_ptr<...>::get()</tt>
 * to an external entity which may delete it unless you call <tt>ref_count_ptr<...>::release()</tt>
 * first.  It is probably better to have a memory leak than to perform multiple
 * deletes on the same pointer.
 \code

 void f( A* ra_ptr )
 {
   ...
   if( ... ) delete ra_ptr;
   ...
 }

 void main()
 {
   ...
   ref_count_ptr<C> c_ptr = rcp(new C);
   ...
   f(c_ptr.get());  // May delete this pointer?
   ...
   // Reguardless of whether f(...) deleted the pointer returned by 
   // c_ptr.get() or not, c_ptr will call delete on this pointer when
   // it is destroyed at the end of the block.
 }
 \endcode
 *
 * To help not break the above hard and fast rules, the following guidelines
 * should be followed when using MemMngPack::ref_count_ptr<tt><...></tt>.
 *
 * 1) Get the raw pointer returned from <tt>new</tt> into a <tt>ref_count_ptr<...></tt> object
 * as soon as possible.
 *
 * The simplest way to do this is to call <tt>new</tt> directly in the call the the 
 * nonmember function \c rcp() as shown below.
 \code
 ref_count_ptr<BaseClass> ptr = rcp(new DerivedClass());
 \endcode
 * To initialize to NULL, use the implicit conversion from the dummy enum value \c null:
 \code
 ref_count_ptr<BaseClass> ptr = null;
 \endcode
 * These are the only ways to initialize a \c ref_count_ptr object with a raw
 * pointer without calling the explicit constructor and a casual user should never
 * call an explicit constructor directly.
 *
 * 2) Use <tt>ref_count_ptr<...></tt> for all of your dynamic memory handling!  The more
 * consistently you use this class, the better your life will be.
 *
 * If everyone plays nice then <tt>ref_count_ptr<...></tt> can give you the illusion of
 * garbage collection in C++.  However, it is not hard to screw things up if you
 * are not careful.
 *
 * The testing program <tt>\ref TestRefCountPtr_grp "TestRefCountPtrMain.cpp"</tt> runs
 * \c ref_count_ptr through the paces and shows some how it is used.
