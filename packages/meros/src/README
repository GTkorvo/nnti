Source files needed in TSF for block preconditoners.
All are in meros/src/.

1. Put (or link) these files in TSF/src/LinearOperators.

   TSFOperatorSourceBase.h
   TSFOperatorSourceBase.cpp
   TSFOperatorSource.h
   TSFOperatorSourceBase.cpp

   These files all add a TSFOperatorSource object to TSF. 
   TSFOperatorSources have GetOp() methods that return operators
   needed by our block preconditioners.

2. Edit TSF/src/Makefile.am. Add the .h files to the list of
   LinearOperators_SOURCES_H and the .cpp files to the list
   of LinearOperators_SOURCES.

3. Put (or link) these files in TSF/src/Preconditioners.
   (Would they make more sense in LinearOperators with the
   TSFOperatorSources?)

   /* basic block preconditioner code */
   NSBlockPreconditionerFactory.h
   NSBlockPreconditionerFactory.cpp

   /* Operator sources for the block preconditioner using only */
   /* the right factor (DU of the LDU factorization).          */
   /* I.e., the Kay & Loghin style preconditioners will use    */
   /* these.                                                   */
   RightBlockNSOperatorSource.h
   RightBlockNSOperatorSource.cpp

   /* Operator sources specific to the Kay and Loghin   */
   /* version of the preconditioner.                    */
   KayLoghinRightOperatorSource.h
   KayLoghinRightOperatorSource.cpp

   /* Factories to build the Schur complement approximations. */
   SchurFactoryBase.h
   SchurFactoryBase.cpp
   SchurFactory.h
   SchurFactory.cpp

   /* Factories to build the Kay and Loghin specific */
   /* Schur complement approximations. */
   KayLoghinSchurFactory.cpp
   KayLoghinSchurFactory.h

4. Edit TSF/src/Makefile.am. Add the .h files to the list of
   Preconditioners_SOURCES_H and the .cpp files to the list
   of Preconditioners_SOURCES.

5. Run TSF/bootstrap.
6. Update configure by running TSF/config.status.
7. Make TSF with TSF/make.










/*****************/
To run meros/examples/saddle_kayloghin.cpp:

1. Make links in TSF/examples/Tests to
   saddle_kayloghin.cpp
   TSFLinearOperator2EpetraRowMatrix.h
   VbrMatrixFile (K_reordered)
   VbrRhsFile (rhs_reordered)
   VbrVectorFile (guess_reordered)

2. From TSF/examples/  
   make Tests/saddle_kayloghin.e
3. From TSF/examples/ run
   Tests/saddle_kayloghin.e
