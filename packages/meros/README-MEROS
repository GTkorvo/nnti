Meros is a segregated preconditioning package. It provides scalable
block preconditioning for problems that coupled simultaneous solution
variables such as Navier-Strokes problems.

Because Meros is currently development only code, there are a number
of restrictions and caveats. These should be fixed when we upgrade
Meros for release (which we hope to do in FY06).

  - all code and user level interfaces may change substantially as we
    develop algorithms, convert to Thyra, and clean up code for release.

  - Meros currently needs an older version of gcc to compile. 
    We recommend gcc 3.2.x.

  - Meros currently depends on the older TSF abstract layer. We will
    convert to Thyra before releasing the code, but for now, you must
    configure Trilinos with TSF.

Below is a sample configure script for Trilinos with Meros. Note that
you need to point to either a gcc 3.2.x or an mpi that was built with
gcc 3.2.x.

Sample build script:
---------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh

BUILD_DIR=`pwd`

../configure CXXFLAGS="-g"                    \
--with-install="/usr/bin/install -c -p"       \
--prefix=$BUILD_DIR                           \
--enable-mpi                                  \
--with-mpi-compilers="/usr/local/mpich-1.2.7_gcc3.2.1/bin" \
--with-mpi-libs="-lmpich"                     \
--cache-file=config.cache                     \
--enable-tsf                                  \
--enable-ifpack                               \
--enable-ml                                   \
--enable-teuchos                              \
--disable-new_package                         \
--enable-meros
