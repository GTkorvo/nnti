\chapter{Vector Spaces and Vector Representations}

The notion of a vector space is central to the mathematics of equation solving,
but does not often appear explicitly in solver codes. 
In the design of HCL, Gockenbach and Symes~\cite{GockSymes} realized the practical 
importance of 
introducing explicit vector space objects. Far from being an unneccessary abstraction,
vector space objects play important practical roles. The most important role
is as a {\bf factory} for new vectors. We will often need to create new vectors while
deep inside a calculation, and 
a factory object lets us know what {\it type} of vector should be created at that time.  
A secondary role for the vector space object is to check compatibility between operands.



\section{The TSFVectorSpace object}

Vector space objects can create new vectors, and also be compared for compatibility
between operands. These two tasks imply two high-level methods of TSFVectorSpace
\begin{verbatim}
TSFVector TSFVectorSpace::createMember() const ;
\end{verbatim}
which returns a new vector, and
\begin{verbatim}
bool TSFVectorSpace::operator==(const TSFVectorSpace& other) const ;
\end{verbatim}
which tests equality between two spaces.

\subsection{Concrete vector space types}

To create a vector space object, you must choose a concrete type



\section{Vector Representations}

A vector representation is a user-level object that specifies the type of vector to 
be used
