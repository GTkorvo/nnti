<BODY>

Upon discretization through finite elements, a linear elliptic PDE
becomes a discrete linear system \f$Ax=b\f$. The role of Sundance is 
to assemble the matrix \f$A\f$ and the vector \f$b\f$.
In most Sundance applications, matrices and vectors
will never appear at the user level: they are hidden within the
solver and their methods are called within the guts of Sundance.

In the course of discretizing a StaticLinearProblem 
(see \ref StaticLinearProblemDoc)
the Sundance internals will configure and fill the matrix through a small
set of callback functions
in the matrix interface. Sundance can work with any matrix
type that implements those callback functions, which means
it is possible to add your own solver to Sundance (see \ref ExtendingSolvers).

Currently Sundance supports two families of linear solvers:

<ul>
<li> Sandia's Aztec family of high-performance parallel solvers.

An AztecSolver is created with one constructor argument: an AztecOptions
object. For example,
\code
  AztecOptions azOpt;
  azOpt.setParameter(AZ_tol, 1.0e-12);
  azOpt.setOption(AZ_max_iter, 500);
  azOpt.setOption(AZ_solver, AZ_bicgstab);
  azOpt.setOption(AZ_output, AZ_last);
  LinearSolver mySolver = new AztecSolver(azOpt);
\endcode
For documentation of the myriad Aztec options and parameters that can go into
an AztecOptions object, see the Aztec user's guide.


<li> Sundance's quick-n-dirty BICGSTAB solver. This is serial only,
has no preconditioners, is not at all optimized,
but is reasonably robust and idiot-proof. It's intended for use in in-house
testing.

A BICGSTABSolver object is created with two constructor arguments: a convergence
tolerance and the maximum number of iterations allowed. For example,
\code
  LinearSolver mySolver = new BICGSTABSolver(1.0e-12, 200);
\endcode
</ul>

\section ExtendingSolvers Adding your own solver

It is possible for you to add your own solver code as a plugin. To do
so, you will need to derive your solver from the Sundance class
LinearSolverBase, and implement the LinearSolverBase interface.
The LinearSolverBase interface works with objects called
MatrixBase and DistributedVector, so you will need to 
implement the MatrixBase interface for your matrix type 
and VectorMapBase for your parallel vectors.
