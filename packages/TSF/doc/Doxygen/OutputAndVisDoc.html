/** \page OutputAndVisDoc Output and visualization

<BODY>

In the current version of Sundance, the only option for visualization
of fields is the temporary matlabDump() method of Expr. This method
can write a discrete scalar-valued function to a stream, in a format 
that can be plotted by matlab. In the examples directory, there are
several matlab scripts for plotting the output of matlabDump(). 

For example,
\code
   // solve a problem and get the soln back as a discrete expression
   problem.solve(soln);
	 
	 // write the solution to a matlab-readable file
	 ofstream myFile("myFile.dat");
	 soln.matlabDump(myFile);
\endcode

We plan to develop a FieldWriter class system that will support
multiple output formats as well as vector-valued fields.
