# Commands to run pass/fail tests
# 
# This is to be included from the makefile in the examples/Tests directory.
# That makefile should contain the following:
# (1) definitions of macros TESTS and PTEST listing the source files
#     for the serial and parallel tests to be run.
# (2) a definition of the NPROC macro specifying the number of processors
#     to be used in parallel tests.
# (3) a definition of the FILES_TO_CLEAN macro listing any temporary files
#     generated by the tests that should be cleaned up.
# (4) A directive to include this file, Makefile.tests.
