- Modified ROL::LinearOperator::apply and ::applyInverse to be const and
  derived classes also modified to have const methods
- Added adapter files for using Belos with ROL for Krylov Newton methods
- Added example to test Belos and ROL

The rol/examples/belos/example_01.cpp test can be used with either Belos
or with ROL's own method by modifying the parameters.xml file. 
Currently it will not use Belos unless you switch the parameter "Use Belos"
to "true." This is because the Krylov.run section does not converge with 
any of the Belos solvers. The shallow copying desired by Belos::MultiVecTraits
is currently carried by deep copy pending addition of cloneView and cloneViewNonConst
to ROL::Vector Interface
