Welcome to Galeri!

Galeri is a small package, whose aim is to let you generate linear systems.
You can either produce finite difference matrices, or several other matrices
of the MATLAB's gallery function, or use the finite element code.

Galeri contains:
- utilities to generate Epetra_Map's, Epetra_CrsMatrix's and
  Epetra_VbrMatrix's;
- two finite element codes: one in src-fem, and a newer version in src-pfem.
  src-fem contains the code previously hosted in ml/examples/FiniteElements.
  This code is extended by the newer version src-pfem, which is under
  development. pfem is a fully parallel, extensible FEM solver.

The Galeri documentation is maintained on the web page of the package; see
