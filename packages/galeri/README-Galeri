Welcome to Galeri!

Galeri is a small package, whose aim is to let you generate linear systems.
You can either produce finite difference matrices, or several other matrices
of the MATLAB's gallery function, or use the finite element code.

The Galeri documentation is maintained on the web page of the package; see

http://software.sandia.gov/trilinos/packages/galeri.
