/*! \mainpage Stratimikos: Thyra-based strategies for linear solvers

The package Stratimikos contains a unified set of Thyra-based wrappers to
linear solver and preconditioner capabilities in Trilinos.  The name
Stratimikos was created from the Greek words "stratigiki" and "grammikos"
which which mean "strategy" and "linear in English.  The word "stratimikos"
itself has no real meaning itself.  The Stratimikos package is also a place
where unified testing of linear solvers and preconditioners can be performed.

<ul>

<li><tt>Thyra::DefaultRealLinearSolverBuilder</tt>: A utility class that
provides uniform access to linear solver capabilities in Trilinos where the
underlying operator can be viewed as either an <tt>Epetra_CrsMatrix</tt>
object or as an <tt>Epetra_RowMatrix</tt> object.  This class builds linear
solvers using the Thyra linear solver and preconditioner factory adapters
given below.

\section stratimikos_lows_adapters_sec Linear solver adapters

These adapters provide concrete subclasses implementing the abstract
interfaces <tt>Thyra::LinearOpWithSolveFactoryBase</tt> and
<tt>Thyra::LinearOpWithSolveBase</tt>.  It is these implementations that are
used in the implementation of <tt>Thyra::DefaultRealLinearSolverBuilder</tt>
but they can also be used on their own.

<ul>

<li><tt>Thyra::AmesosLinearOpWithSolveFactory</tt> : Amesos/Thyra adatpers.
Must be enabled with <tt>--enable-amesos</tt>.

<li><tt>Thyra::AztecOOLinearOpWithSolveFactory</tt> : AztecOO/Thyra adatpers.
Must be enabled with <tt>--enable-aztecoo</tt>.

<li><tt>Thyra::BelosLinearOpWithSolveFactory</tt> : Belos/Thyra adatpers.
Must be enabled with <tt>--enable-belos</tt>.
