/*! \mainpage Stratimikos: Thyra-based strategies for linear solvers

The package Stratimikos contains a unified set of Thyra-based wrappers to
linear solver and preconditioner capabilities in Trilinos.  The name
Stratimikos was created from the Greek words "stratigiki" and "grammikos"
which which mean "strategy" and "linear in English.  The word "stratimikos"
itself has not real meaning itself.  The Stratimikos package is also a place
where unified testing of linear solvers and preconditioners can be performed.
