    /*!
     * \brief A %wrapper class for wrapping a %NOX solver.
     */
    /*!
     * The %LOCA::Solver::Wrapper class provides a wrapper for %NOX solvers
     * to change the group data returned by getSolutionGroup() and 
     * getPreviousSolutionGroup() so that status tests can operate correctly.
     * %LOCA continuation and bifurcation algorithms are implemented by
     * extended groups which augment the nonlinear equations defining
     * equilibrium solutions with appropriate continuation/bifurcation
     * equations.  Therefore the groups returned by getSolutionGroup() and
     * getPreviousSolutionGroup() will be groups corresponding to the 
     * continuation/bifurcation equations, not the underlying group.
     * Status tests that are designed to use concrete data from the original
     * underlying group (e.g., NOX::StatusTest::NormWRMS) will then fail
     * (usually via a segmentation fault or raised exception) when applied
     * to the extended continuation or bifurcation groups.  
     *
     * This solver wrapper class fixes this problem by reimplementing the
     * solution group accessor methods to return the underlying groups of 
     * the solution groups 
     * (via LOCA::Extended::AbstractGroup::getUnderlyingGroup()) if they are 
     * extended groups (derived from LOCA::Extended::AbstractGroup).  If the
     * groups are not extended groups, the original solution groups are 
     * returned.  All other NOX::Solver::Generic methods are passed to the
     * wrapped solver.
     *
     * The LOCA::StatusTest::Wrapper class uses this wrapper class to wrap
     * the solver supplied via the checkStatus method which is then forwarded
     * to the original status test.  When used properly, the group "seen" by
     * the status test is of the appropriate type for the status test.
