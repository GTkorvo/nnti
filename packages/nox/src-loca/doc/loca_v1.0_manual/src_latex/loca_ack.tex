We would like to thank John Shadid, David Womble, and Sudip Dosanjh for their efforts in defining, guiding, and supporting this project. We would also like to thank John Shadid, David Day, Karen Devine, Mike Heroux, Mark Adams, Laura Frink, Randy Schunk and Eric Phipps for many useful discussions that have helped us make decisions on algorithms, software design, and licensing.

We are grateful for the financial support of DOE, in particular the MICS division for algorithmic research, the ASCI program for software development and documentation, and the CSRF program for scalability studies with initial applications.
