To compile ml ...

I.  Use the configure/make method.

or ...

II.  There are two scripts 'installer' and 'etc/ml_install'.

1) The first script is interactive and prompts you for input. To use this,
   type 'installer' from the 'ml/' directory.
or
2) The second script reads specifications from an input file. A sample
   file 'etc/install_options' can be changed to configure for your system.
   Trilinos users should use etc/install_TrilinosSerial or etc/install_TrilinosMPI
   instead of /etc/install_options.
   To use this script,
     a) cd etc
     b) edit install_options
     c) ml_install install_options 
        NOTE: Trilinos users would do 
               i) ml_install install_TrilinosSerial
                     or
              ii) ml_install install_TrilinosMPI


If these scripts don't work, tooo bad. There are some comments given
in the top of 'installer' for doing things manually.
