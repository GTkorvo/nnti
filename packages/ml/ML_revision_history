mystring = ml2_0_0_0 

AMG for Maxwell's equations

     Reitzinger Schoeberl AMG.
     Hiptmair smoother.

mystring = ml2_0_0_1 

     MLS polynomial smoother
         matrix does not need to be scaled.
     Added more print control.
		 "ml_inputfile" now takes an additional argument in the general
		 problem specs section:
		 "Print Level = [an integer]"
		 0 => minimal output
		 1 => some output (default)
		 2,3,... => increasing amounts of output

mystring = ml2_0_0_2

     Symmetrize Hiptmair smoother and finished off MLS within Hiptmair. 

mystring = ml2_0_0_3

     Added in smoothing of Reitzinger/Schoeberl prolongator.
     Least squares and smoothed l.s. prolongators in serial for R/S AMG.
     Enhanced detection of degenerate coarse grid matrices in building
     R/S AMG hierarchy.

mystring = ml2_0_0_4

mystring = ml2_0_0_5

     Changes in aggregation post-processing to improve aggregate quality.
     Added wrappers so that ML can use Epetra objects & so that AztecOO can use
       ML as a preconditioner.
     Added block Maxwell capabilities for real block systems that are
       equivalent to the complex systems arising from Maxwell in the frequency
       domain.

mystring = ml2_1_0_0

    Many minor fixes to get the commuting relationship T_h P_n = P_e T_H
    exactly right.
    Serial implementation of enriched prolongator.
    New norm for convergence of Maxwell solver.  This norm measure and scales
    properly the range space and null space components of the (curl,curl)
    operator.

mystring = ml2_1_0_0-branch

    Tag corresponding to trilinos-release-3-01-branch.

mystring = ml2_1_0_0-branch-patch_1

    1st patch for release ml2_1_0_0 (trilinos-release-3-01-branch).
    Bug fix for eigenvalue estimate that was causing Alegra sinmag benchmark to
    fail.
    Added definitions for make macro CXX in architecture-dependent makefiles
    in order for Alegra to be able to build epetra interfaces.
    Minor changes to block matrix (equivalent real form) capabilities.
    Fixed compiler warnings.

mystring = ml2_1_1_0-merge

    Merged in ml2_1_0_0-branch-patch_1 to main trunk.  (The trunk is what you
    get with "cvs checkout ml").

mystring = ml3_0

    ML has now been put "autotooled", i.e., autoconf and automake.
    Haim Waisman's GGB method has been implemented.
    Bill Cochran's cache optimizations for multiple RHSs have been implemented.
    Bill also has added code so that ML will compile with c++ compilers.
