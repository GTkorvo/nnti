***************************************************************************
ml_aztec_simple.c:

This example creates a simple matrix, corresponding to a 2D Laplacian on a
structured grid, as an Aztec matrix. This matrix is wrapped as an ML_Operator,
then the V-cycle is built, and the resulting preconditioner is used within
Aztec (C version). The example works with the AztecOO distributed withint
Trilinos.

***************************************************************************
ml_operator.cpp:

The goal of this example is to present the usage of the
ML_Epetra::MultiLevelOperator class. This can should be used if the
user wants to build all the ML components by him/herself (starting
from an Epetra_RowMatrix), then use the resulting ML preconditioner within 
AztecOO. The file also shows how to read an Harwell/Boeing matrix and convert 
it into Epetra_CrsMatrix, then redistribute the matrix on the available 
number of processors. An example Harwell/Boeing matrix is include which
can be run by trying something like
   mpirun -np 4 ./ml_operator.exe -matrix_name=gr_30_30.rsa

***************************************************************************
ml_preconditioner.cpp (RECOMMENDED):

The goal of this example is to present the basic usage of the
ML_Epetra::MultiLevelPreconditioner class.  The example builds a simple matrix
and solves the corresponding linear system using AztecOO and ML as a
preconditioner. It finally checks the accuracy of the computed solution.


***************************************************************************
ml_readex.c:
***************************************************************************

The goal of this example is to read old Aztec files (.data) and
use the old/low level multigrid interface to set up a preconditioner.
A hidden file '.data' is included which correspond to a simple finite
element model of a Laplacian.
