0)  ML can be built with automake and autoconfig.   For ML-specific flags, at
the ml directory level, type "./configure --help".

The following items are enabled by default:

        vendor blas & lapack (i.e., not ml's internal versions)
        epetra & aztec support
        the latest Maxwell prolongator improvements

The following items are NOT enabled by default:

        MPI
        SuperLU

1) If you prefer to build with the old makefile system, look at the INSTALL
file for general hints on compiling ML.

2) Look in the doc directory for documentation.

3) There are several Mailing lists that you can sign up for
   to get information updates about ML. They can be found
   at the following address: 
       http://software.sandia.gov/mailman/listinfo

   For most people, the lists ML-Announce and ML-Users will
   be of most interest.

4) Finally, there is a bugzilla interface for reporting bugs
   and enhancement requests. This can be found at 
       http://software.sandia.gov/bugzilla
