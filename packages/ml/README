0)  ML can be built with automake and autoconfig.   For ML-specific flags, at
    the ml directory level, type "./configure --help".  Here are ML specific
    configure options.

    --enable-ml_multiple_rhs
    --enable-ml_enrich
    --enable-ml_newtpe
    --enable-ml_timing
    --enable-ml_flops
    --with-ml_epetra
    --with-ml_aztec
    --with-ml_external_mpi_functions
    --with-ml_superlu

    The following items are enabled by default:

        vendor blas & lapack (i.e., not ml's internal versions)
        epetra & aztec support
        the latest Maxwell prolongator improvements

    The following items are NOT enabled by default:

        MPI
        SuperLU

    Here is an example configure and build line:

     > cd /home/jhu/Trilinos/packages/ml
     > ./configure --with-mpi-compilers=/usr/local/mpich/bin --with-ml_superlu \
        --with-ldflags="/usr/local/superlu/lib/libsuperlu.a" \
        --with-incdirs="-I/usr/local/superlu/include"
     > make

    In general it's not a good idea to configure in the
    Trilinos/packages/ml directory structure.   Instead, you should make a
    "sandbox" where you configure and build, away from the Trilinos source.
    See the file Trilinos/config/AUTOTOOLS_README for details.


1)  If you prefer to build with the old makefile system, look at the INSTALL
    file for general hints on compiling ML.


2)  Look in the doc directory for documentation.


3)  There are several Mailing lists that you can sign up for
    to get information updates about ML. They can be found
    at the following address: 
       http://software.sandia.gov/mailman/listinfo

    For most people, the lists ML-Announce and ML-Users will
    be of most interest.


4)  Finally, there is a bugzilla interface for reporting bugs
    and enhancement requests. This can be found at 
        http://software.sandia.gov/bugzilla
