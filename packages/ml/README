1) Look at the INSTALL file for general hints on compiling ML.

2) Look in the doc directory for documentation.

3) There are several Mailing lists that you can sign up for
   to get information updates about ML. They can be found
   at the following address: 
       http://software.sandia.gov/mailman/listinfo

   For most people, the lists ML-Announce and ML-Users will
   be of most interest.

4) Finally, there is a bugzilla interface for reporting bugs
   and enhancement requests. This can be found at 
       http://software.sandia.gov/bugzilla
