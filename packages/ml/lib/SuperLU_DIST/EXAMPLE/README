		SuperLU_DIST  EXAMPLES

This directory contains sample programs to illustrate how to use
various functions provded in SuperLU_DIST. You can modify these
examples to suit your applications.

The command line options "-r <process rows>" and "-c <process columns>"
defines the 2-D process grid. The total number of processes <procs> is:
	<procs> = <process rows> * <process columns>
If the options is not provided at the command line, the programs
will use 1 as default in each case.

Two sample matrices are provided in this directory: g20.rua is
a real matrix and cg20.cua is a complex matrix.


1. To run the real examples (pddrive, pddrive1, pddrive2 and pddrive3),
   you may type:
   % mpprun -n <procs> pddrive -r <process row> -c <process columns> g20.rua

2. To run the real example pddrive4, you may type:
   % mpprun -n 10 pddrive4 g20.rua
   
3. To run the complex examples (pzdrive, pzdrive1, pzdrive2 and pzdrive3),
   you may type:
   % mpprun -n <procs> pzdrive -r <process row> -c <process columns> cg20.cua

4. To run the complex example pzdrive4, you may type:
   % mpprun -n 10 pzdrive4 cg20.rua
