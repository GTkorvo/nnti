Aztec 1.1 users should also read 'doc/release_2.0-notes.txt'
to see what has changed.


To install Aztec 2.0, you must:

 1) Obtain LAPACK, BLAS, and Y12M from the netlib mail-server.

   a) TYPE ===> cd get_packages; mail netlib@ornl.gov < netlib_mail

      About 14 messages will be sent to you in response to this request.

   b) STORE messages in: file_a, file_b, ... , file_n (any order).

   c) TYPE ===> process_netlib ; cd ..

      NOTE: Usually, mail headers do not need to be removed. However, it may 
      be necessary to remove one or two lines appended by some mail programs.

 2) Compile.

   a) Edit the files 'lib/Makefile.template' and 'app/Makefile.template'
      Set the Makefile variables MPI_INCLUDE_DIR and MPI_LIB to the 
      appropriate directories and libraries (if using MPI). For example

          MPI_INCLUDE_DIR = -I/Net/local/mpi/include
          MPI_LIB         = -L/Net/local/mpi -lmpich

   b) TYPE ===> set_makefiles  xxxx   yyyy

      where xxxx specifies a machine (SOLARIS, SUN4, SGI, SGIM4, SGI10K, I860, 
      DEC, HP, SUNMOS, NCUBE, SP2, T3E, LINUX, or TFLOP) and yyyy specifies a 
      messaging system (MPI, SERIAL, I860, SUNMOS, or NCUBE).
                                                               
      Example:  set_makefiles SUN4 MPI

      This creates 'Makefile.xxxx.yyyy' which is linked to Makefile.

   c) TYPE ===> cd lib; make; cd ../app; make 

      'gmake' works on all machines except the Cray T3E where it appears 
      necessary to uncomment Makefile lines refering to implicit compilation.

   Other applications can be compiled by switching OBJ lines in app/Makefile.

   NOTE: On some machines it is necessary to switch the linker 'LD_*' when
         the main program is Fortran.

------------------------------------------------------------------
When porting to other machines, the following issues are the most difficult:

   1) Linking between Fortran and C differs between machines. 'lib/az_aztec.h'
      contains macros corresponding to CFORT in the Makefiles.

   2) Timing routines are different between machines. With any luck, one of the
      following should work: md_timer_sun.c, md_timer_generic.c, md_timer_mpi.c.
