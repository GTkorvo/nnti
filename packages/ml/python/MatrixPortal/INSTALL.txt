These are some short instructions for installing MatrixPortal on your local
machine.  You will need root or sudo access.

System requirements
-------------------

Linux or Mac OS
apache http and php servers running
python      Version 2.x or greater.
swig        Version x.x or greater.
numpy       Version x.x or greater.
PyChart      Version x.x or greater.
PyChart      Version x.x or greater.

Trilinos    Configured, compiled, and *installed*.  "--enable-pytrilinos" and
            "--enable-python" are required configuration options.  See
            configure.txt for an example configuration line.



How to install
--------------

Edit the file ml/python/MatrixPortal/common/config.php.  Add a section for your
machine, using one of the previous sections as a template.  Set $MACHINE equal
to the label of the section you just created.

Next, you need to create a few directories and links.

1) Create a symbolic link in /var/www/html to the MatrixPortal directory that
contains step_process.py.

2) Create the directories for your definitions of $HBMatrixDirectory,
$H5MatrixDirectory, $TempDirectory, and $ImageDirectory.


FAQs
----
In step 1, if you see "Linear problems from the Harwell/Boeing collection" at
the very bottom of the page with nothing following it, you have probably made a
mistake in common/config.php.


Known problems
--------------

Parallel does not currently work.
