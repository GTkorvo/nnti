# This script is used for running a series of benchmark tests.
# Users indicate a directory containing subdirectories which 
# describe data corresponding to different problems (one directory
# for each problem). The script automatically descends each 
# subdirectory and runs the executable (given on the command line)
# within the subdirectory. All data necessary to run the executable
# must be within this subdirectory. The problem is run and the output
# is compared with an output file in this subdirectory. Some summary
# statistics are reported.
# Note: This script is often used with the executable ml_readfile
#        which contains comments on setting up problems.
