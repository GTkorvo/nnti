# Utility for compressing source files into 1 directory via links.
#
#   Usage:    flatten [directory]
#
#        If directory is ommited, this creates a directory called 'flat'.
#
# Note: The makefile associated with the resulting flattened directory
#       uses `depends.ml'. This file assumes that the source code is
#       in a directory 'flat'. If there is no such directory, things don't
#       work. Thus, the first time this utility should be run without
#       specifying a directory. Subsequent invokations can then be used
#       to create additional Obj directories.
