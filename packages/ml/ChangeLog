------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
May 2004 (current version 3.0, distributed with Trilinos 4.0)

	* Update the ml user's guide (in the doc subdirectory)
	* Improved interface to C++. Introduced two classes to use
	  ML as a preconditioner for Epetra_LinearProblem (both in the
	  ML_Epetra namespace): MultiLevelOperator and 
	  MultiLevelPreconditioner.
	* Basic feaures to solve Maxwell equations via MultiLevelPreconditioner
	  are now supported
	* Improved interface to Amesos. Now ML can use Anasazi to estimate
	  the maximum eigenvalue for both symmetric and non-symmetric
	  problems.
	* Improve interface to Anasazi
	* Add power method to estimate lambda max for non-syymmetric
	  problems
	* Improve the MLS preconditioner for block systems
	* New options for configure. Drop --with-ml_epetra (and similar
	  for other Trilinos packages), and use --enable-epetra (and similar)
	* Fixed various compiler warnings for LINUX (GNU and Intel),
	  SGI 64, DEC, west-cplant, ASCI Red

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apr 2004
	
	* Change to support new Teuchos methods' name
	* Change to support new Amesos methods' name
	* Now support to ML native interface to SuperLU and SuperLUDIST
	  is deprecated in favor of Amesos interface
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jan 2004
	
	* Add METIS and ParMETIS aggregation schemes
	* Add Teuchos support
	* Add interface to Amesos
	* Add interface to IFPACK
	* Add interface to Anasazi
	* Add configure options --with-ml_epetra, --with-ml_parmetis2x,
	  --with-ml_parmetis3x, --with-ml_ifpack, --with-ml_anasazi
	* Add two-level additive and hybrid domain decomposition
	  preconditioners (not officially supported)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
Sep 2003 (version 2.0, distributed with Trilinos 3.1)
	
	* ML has now been put "autotooled", i.e., autoconf and automake.
    	* Haim Waisman's GGB method has been implemented.
    	* Bill Cochran's cache optimizations for multiple RHSs have been 
	  implemented.
    	* Bill also has added code so that ML will compile with c++ compilers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
ml2_1_0_0-branch-patch_1
	
	* 1st patch for release ml2_1_0_0 (trilinos-release-3-01-branch).
	* Bug fix for eigenvalue estimate that was causing Alegra 
	  sinmag benchmark to fail.
	* Added definitions for make macro CXX in architecture-dependent 
	  makefiles in order for Alegra to be able to build epetra interfaces.
	* Minor changes to block matrix (equivalent real form)
	  capabilities.
	* Fixed compiler warnings.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
mystring = ml2_1_0_0

	* Many minor fixes to get the commuting relationship T_h P_n = P_e T_H
	  exactly right.
	* Serial implementation of enriched prolongator.
	* New norm for convergence of Maxwell solver.  This norm measure
	  and scales properly the range space and null space components of
	  the (curl,curl) operator.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
mystring = ml2_0_0_5

	* Changes in aggregation post-processing to improve aggregate quality.
	* Added wrappers so that ML can use Epetra objects & so that 
	  AztecOO can use ML as a preconditioner.
	* Added block Maxwell capabilities for real block systems that are
	  equivalent to the complex systems arising from Maxwell in the 
	  frequency domain.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
mystring = ml2_0_0_3

	* Added in smoothing of Reitzinger/Schoeberl prolongator.
	* Least squares and smoothed l.s. prolongators in serial for R/S AMG.
	* Enhanced detection of degenerate coarse grid matrices in building
	  R/S AMG hierarchy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

mystring = ml2_0_0_2

	* Symmetrize Hiptmair smoother and finished off MLS within Hiptmair. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
ml2_0_0_1 

	* MLS polynomial smoother
        * matrix does not need to be scaled.
     	* Added more print control:
	  - "ml_inputfile" now takes an additional argument in the general
	  - problem specs section:
	  - "Print Level = [an integer]"
	  - 0 => minimal output
	  - 1 => some output (default)
	  - 2,3,... => increasing amounts of output

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
ml2_0_0_0 

	* AMG for Maxwell's equations
     	* Reitzinger Schoeberl AMG.
     	* Hiptmair smoother.
