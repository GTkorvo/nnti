Overview of main ML changes from ml-2.0 to ml-3.0
-------------------------------------------------


The ML version contained in Trilinos 4.0 has been enhanced with respect
to the one included in the Trilinos 3.1 distribution as follows:

- ML now has extended capabilities to define preconditioners for
Epetra_LinearProblem objects. Two new classes have been 
introduced (both in the ML_Epetra namespace): MultiLevelOperator (derived from
Epetra_Operator) and MultiLevelPreconditioner (derived from Epetra_RowMatrix).
The latter is particularly easy to use, and requires, as input parameters, the
linear system matrix, and a list of parameters only. Using this class, 
ML can be used as a black-box solver to define multilevel (possibly domain
decomposition based) preconditioners.  

- ML users can take advantage of several other Trilinos packages: Epetra,
  Teuchos, Amesos, Anasazi, Triutils, IFPACK. 

- ML uses Teuchos to specify the input parameters for
ML_Epetra::MultiLevelPreconditioner objects, and in 
some other internal classes (mainly, the interface with Amesos and Anasazi).

- ML now supports the Trilinos package Amesos as primary direct
sequential and parallel direct solvers. Through Amesos, KLU, UMFPACK
4.1, SuperLU_DIST 2.0, MUMPS 4.3.1, and ScaLAPACK can be used. The user can
specify the maximum number of processes to be used in the coarse
solution, or let Amesos decide.

- ML interface to SuperLU and SuperLU_DIST is now deprecated in favor of
the Amesos interface (but still available).

- ML can use the Trilinos package Anasazi to estimate the maximum eigenvalue for
both symmetric and non-symmetric problems.

- A basic interface to the Trilinos package IFPACK is available.

- Two new aggregation schemes, based on graph partitioning algorithms,
have been added. Interfaces to the third-party libraries METIS and ParMETIS
are available. Users can now specify the number of nodes to be included in each
aggregate (or the number of local or global aggregates); this allows aggressive
coarsening. ML must be configured with options --with-ml_metis and 
--with-ml_parmetis_3x to use graph partitioning algorithms. ParMETIS support
requires Epetra. 

- ML can use a simple power method to estimate the maximum eigenvalue for
non-symmetric problems, in addition to the A-norm scheme.
 
- The set of examples has been extended. Now about 30 examples are available,
mainly in C. A couple of C++ examples, that use
Trilinos_Utils::CrsMatrixGallery to define the linear system matrix, is included
in the distribution. 

- Improved the MLS preconditioner for block systems.

- In the configuration phase, ML automatically recognizes which Trilinos
package has been enabled, and compiles all functions sing this package (if any).

- (Limited) visualization and statistics capabilities are available for METIS
and Uncoupled aggregation schemes. The user can visualize the shape of the
aggregates for all levels using OpenDX. 

- (Limited) doxygen documentation is available. Type doxygen in the doc
subdirectory to create the documentation. Almost all the C++ code, and a small
part of the C code, has been modified with doxygen-compatible comments.

- A new user's guide is available in the doc subdirectory (Sandia report
SAND-2004-22195). 

==============================================================================
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
May 2004 (current version 3.0, distributed with Trilinos 4.0)

	* Update the ml user's guide (in the doc subdirectory)
	* Improved interface to C++. Introduced two classes to use
	  ML as a preconditioner for Epetra_LinearProblem (both in the
	  ML_Epetra namespace): MultiLevelOperator and 
	  MultiLevelPreconditioner.
	* Basic feaures to solve Maxwell equations via MultiLevelPreconditioner
	  are now supported
	* Improved interface to Amesos. Now ML can use Anasazi to estimate
	  the maximum eigenvalue for both symmetric and non-symmetric
	  problems.
	* Improve interface to Anasazi
	* Add power method to estimate lambda max for non-syymmetric
	  problems
	* Improve the MLS preconditioner for block systems
	* New options for configure. Drop --with-ml_epetra (and similar
	  for other Trilinos packages), and use --enable-epetra (and similar)
	* Fixed various compiler warnings for LINUX (GNU and Intel),
	  SGI 64, DEC, west-cplant, ASCI Red

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apr 2004
	
	* Change to support new Teuchos methods' name
	* Change to support new Amesos methods' name
	* Now support to ML native interface to SuperLU and SuperLUDIST
	  is deprecated in favor of Amesos interface
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jan 2004
	
	* Add METIS and ParMETIS aggregation schemes
	* Add Teuchos support
	* Add interface to Amesos
	* Add interface to IFPACK
	* Add interface to Anasazi
	* Add configure options --with-ml_epetra, --with-ml_parmetis2x,
	  --with-ml_parmetis3x, --with-ml_ifpack, --with-ml_anasazi
	* Add two-level additive and hybrid domain decomposition
	  preconditioners (not officially supported)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
Sep 2003 (version 2.0, distributed with Trilinos 3.1)
	
	* ML has now been put "autotooled", i.e., autoconf and automake.
    	* Haim Waisman's GGB method has been implemented.
    	* Bill Cochran's cache optimizations for multiple RHSs have been 
	  implemented.
    	* Bill also has added code so that ML will compile with c++ compilers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
ml2_1_0_0-branch-patch_1
	
	* 1st patch for release ml2_1_0_0 (trilinos-release-3-01-branch).
	* Bug fix for eigenvalue estimate that was causing Alegra 
	  sinmag benchmark to fail.
	* Added definitions for make macro CXX in architecture-dependent 
	  makefiles in order for Alegra to be able to build epetra interfaces.
	* Minor changes to block matrix (equivalent real form)
	  capabilities.
	* Fixed compiler warnings.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
mystring = ml2_1_0_0

	* Many minor fixes to get the commuting relationship T_h P_n = P_e T_H
	  exactly right.
	* Serial implementation of enriched prolongator.
	* New norm for convergence of Maxwell solver.  This norm measure
	  and scales properly the range space and null space components of
	  the (curl,curl) operator.

mystring = ml2_0_0_5

	* Changes in aggregation post-processing to improve aggregate quality.
	* Added wrappers so that ML can use Epetra objects & so that 
	  AztecOO can use ML as a preconditioner.
	* Added block Maxwell capabilities for real block systems that are
	  equivalent to the complex systems arising from Maxwell in the 
	  frequency domain.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	  - "ml_inputfile" now takes an additional argument in the general
	  - problem specs section:
	  - "Print Level = [an integer]"
	  - 0 => minimal output
	  - 1 => some output (default)
	  - 2,3,... => increasing amounts of output

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
