This directory contains the "elements" for the Trilinos test harness suite.
The perl executable, $TRILINOS/testharness/test-harness.plx, must be executed
from the $TRILINOS/testharness subdirectory. Results will be placed in
$TRILINOS/testharness/results.

Each machine should have its `elements-machine' file (for example, linux-csmr02).

Each set of configure options should have its `element-trilinos' file
(for example, `basic') and the corresponding input file for test-harness.plx
(for example, `script-basic'). By convention, the test file has the name of the
element-trilinos file, with the prefix "script-".

Currently available list of configure options:
- standalone		ML alone, no other Trilinos package is compiled)
- basic 		ML with Epetra, AztecOO and triutils only (no Teuchos)
			This is essentially ML with AztecOO support only
- trilinos		This is the basic usage of ML, using Epetra, AztecOO, triutils,
			Amesos, Anasazi and Teuchos
- trilinos-parmetis	as `trilinos', but with metis and parmetis

Some more comments can be found in `test.sh'.

Still to do:
- MPI support
- more machines
- send results to developers
- support for automatic CVS update
