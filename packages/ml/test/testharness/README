This directory contains a collection of scripts that can be used
to test IFPACK using the $TRILINOS/testharness/test-herness.plx script.

The perl executable requires three `elements', one for the machine,
the other for MPI, and the last one for the Trilinos options. Files
placed in $IFPACK/test/testharness should contain a combination of these
elements, to test IFPACK in a very detail form. (Note, this IFPACK test should
exercise the IFPACK features that the Trilinos regression is not
testing.)

Subdirectory $IFPACK/test/testharness should be organized as follows:
each new machine should have a subdirectory (for example, `marzio-laptop').
Then, each of these subdirectory should contain a set of elements
for at least for following configurations:
- basic 		IFPACK with Epetra, AztecOO and triutils only 
                        (no Teuchos)
- teuchos               basic + teuchos
- metis                 basic + teuchos + metis

Each subdirectory should also contain a script file (see
$ML/test/testharness/marzio-laptop/test-all.sh for an example), which can be
executed by cron. This script should simply call
$TRILINOS/testharness/test-harness.plx, which must be executed from the
$TRILINOS/testharness subdirectory. This script places the results in
$TRILINOS/testharness/results. (This dictory is wiped out each time the script
is executed.) See more comments in `test-all.sh'.
