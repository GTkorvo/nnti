This directory contains a collection of scripts that can be used
to test ML using the $TRILINOS/testharness/test-herness.plx script.

The perl executable requires three `elements', one for the machine,
the other for MPI, and the last one for the Trilinos options. Files
placed in $ML/test/testharness should contain a combination of these
elements, to test ML in a very detail form. (Note, this ML test should
exercise the ML features that the Trilinos regression is not
testing.)

Subdirectory $ML/test/testharness should be organized as follows:
each new machine should have a subdirectory (for example, `marzio-laptop').
Then, each of these subdirectory should contain a set of elements
for at least for following configurations:
- standalone		ML alone, no other Trilinos package is compiled)
- epetra                ML with epetra, but without AztecOO
- basic 		ML with Epetra, AztecOO and triutils only (no Teuchos)
			This is essentially ML with AztecOO support only
- trilinos		This is the basic usage of ML, using Epetra, 
                        AztecOO, triutils, Amesos, Anasazi and Teuchos
- trilinos-parmetis	as `trilinos', but with metis and parmetis

Each subdirectory should also contain a script file (see
$ML/test/testharness/marzio-laptop/test.sh for an example), which can be
executed by cron. This script should simply call
$TRILINOS/testharness/test-harness.plx, which must be executed from the
$TRILINOS/testharness subdirectory. This script places the results in
$TRILINOS/testharness/results. (This dictory is wiped out each time the script
is executed.) See more comments in `test.sh'.


Still to do:
-----------
- MPI support
- more machines (mac osx?)
- send results to developers
- support for automatic CVS update
