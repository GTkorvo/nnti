     repository.

This file will be a change log, describing updates made between releases.

Change log:

11/25/2001   <v1.0.0-pre-4> Added the column- oriented classes to 
             mirror the row-oriented versions (per Ben Allan's request).  
             Added 'row' and 'col' to a couple methods in the row-oriented
             and column-oriented classes, respectively, so as to 
             distinguish between row and column operations in the 
             unlikely event that someone implements both in one class.
             These are contained to the 'pointer access' class I believe
             and are consistent with the method naming in the other
             classes (so, we probably should have done that anyway). 
             Also modified all the row/col access classes to use
             (global, zero-based) index in place of 'row number' or
             'column number' since all instances of 'number' actually
             referred to 'global index'. //RLC

11/11/2001   Not much has changed since the pre-2 release.  Alan added
             the setOperator method to esi::Preconditioner and cleaned
             up the documentation of that class and the transpose PC
             class. Otherwise, this is essentially the same interface 
             as the pre-1 release modulo comments from 10/29/01 (pre-2 
             release). //RLC

10/29/2001   Modified esi::Vector documentation to use 'this' per Barry 
             Smith's suggestion (file: esi/cxx/include/esi/Vector.h).

             Added pointer initialization language to indicate C 
             ANSI/ISO standard behaviour for 'data' pointer args per 
             Ben Allan's suggestion (files: esi/cxx/include/esi/Vector.h
             esi/cxx/include/esi/VectorReplaceAccess.h, 
             esi/cxx/include/esi/MatrixRowWriteAccess.h
             esi/cxx/include/esi/MatrixRowPointerAccess.h
             esi/cxx/include/esi/IndexSpace.h).

             Changed method 'copyInRow' to 'copyIntoRow' in 
             esi::MatrixRowWriteAccess for consistency with 'sumIntoRow' 
             methods (file: esi/cxx/include/esi/MatrixRowWriteAccess.h).

             Misc. cleanup of the documentation, including removing some 
             doxygen errors in Vector.h ('make docs' builds with 
             doxygen-1.2.10, graphviz-1.7.9, tcl-8.3.2, and tk-8.3.2). //RLC

9/26/2001    Fixed lingering Map and MapPartition references which 
             were missed when we merged those classes into the IndexSpace
             class.  Thanks to Satish Balay (ANL) for spotting this as
             quickly as he did.  Repackaged the distribution as 
             "1.0.0-pre-1" release.  //RLC

9/25/2001    Fixed all known outstanding issues in preparation for 
             1.0.0 vote.  Map and MapPartition classes have been merged
             into the IndexSpace class.  This version is being sent up
             for an official vote as the 1.0.0 spec.  Hence, this release
             is labled "1.0.0-prerelease-0".  //RLC
 
9/3/2001     Put in all known outstanding patches to the C++ headers 
             in esi/cxx/include/esi and fixed ref-tsc implemenation to
             work with the updated headers.  To use the new headers, you
             need to cd to the esi/cxx/include/esi directory, and follow
             the README to build the headers for a specific platform.
             Packaged all that up and put it on the web as version 
             esi-0.9.5. //Robert L. Clay, TeraScale, LLC

8/29/2001    Added sub-directory esi/cxx/include/esi, and made an entire
             major wave of changes to files in that directory, hopefully
             bringing that to a state where we removed the headers in the
             directory above.  Packaged all that up and put it on the web
             as version 0.9.4.tgz.  //Robert L. Clay, TeraScale, LLC

2/15/2001    Set up new CVS for C++ headers and created the doxygen 
             configuration file.  Also, set up makefiles for top-level and 
             doc-level builds.  Modified the configuration files to build 
             the 'traits' stuff in the cxx/include directory.  
             Acknowledgements go to Ben Allan and Alan Williams for their 
             help getting this started, as they set up an initial structure 
             which we used as a model of how to get this all started.

             I'm going to somewhat arbitrarily call the current state of the 
             code/spec esi-0.9.0, since we haven't rolled in the last 
             (albeit minor) changes to come up to official v1.0 spec.

2/20/2001    Put the version number at the top of this file as explicit
             indicator of the version of the code.  This does *not* track
             the CVS version numbering.  Authors are requested to modify
             (i.e., increment) the version number when checking in any
             changes sufficient to warrent a 'new' distribution number.
