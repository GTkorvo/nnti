\begin{abstract}

Implicit sparse linear solution methods are at the core of 
many physics and engineering models. While modern solver 
libraries provide excellent solution capabilities, no single 
library is capable of solving the full range of problems 
encountered today (e.g., multi-billion-cell, 3D, multi-physics 
finite element models characteristic of ASCI applications). 
Furthermore, interoperability between numerical libraries is 
extremely limited, as these libraries have been developed 
independently. The Equation Solver Interface (ESI) standards 
effort has produced a set of component interface specifications 
which promote the integration of equation-solver services and 
components. This report defines the ESI v1.0 specification, and
includes background documentation for developers and users of the
specification.

The ESI v1.0 specification addresses linear system 
assembly abstractions, distributed-memory partitioning 
abstractions, and numerical linear component abstractions.  This v1.0 
specification
contains the first ``complete'' set of language bindings and 
related documentation for the core abstractions (objects and interfaces).
Included are the APIs for map, vector, matrix, operator, solver, and 
preconditioner components.  This constitutes a core set of bases classes
upon which libraries can be built.  Work has begun but remains to be 
done for related abstractions such as eigen-solvers and multi-level methods.
