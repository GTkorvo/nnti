\chapter{ESI Class Hierarchy and Global Definitions}

In this chapter we outline the overall (object-oriented) design
of the ESI classes (components), including the 'global' definitions
associated with the specification.

In the first section we present the hierarchy of the core (base) classes, 
and discuss the overall design concepts including the prolific use of
multiple inheritance.  The second section describes the 'core' ESI
object class, a parent class to all other ESI classes.  The third section
describes the global defintions assiciated with the ESI specification.
