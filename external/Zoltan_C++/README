Basic Usage of Zoltan C++ Interface
-----------------------------------

SETUP
-----
1. Set ZOLTAN_H_INCLUDES= (location of zoltan header files)
2. Be sure $TRILINOS_HOME/build is setup as appropriate for Trilinos builds
3. library will be placed in $TRILINOS_HOME/lib/{ARCH}/libzoltan_cpp.a

Version 1.0:

1. class Zoltan_LoadBalance is the main wrapper interface.
	- The Zoltan routines are wrapped by methods.
	- Main difference, lb_struct is missing from the parameters
	  since the class object contains this structure.

2. Basic Load Balance setup follows the Zoltan manual.
	- construct Zoltan_LoadBalance object (this runs LB_Init)
	- LBObject.Create( MPI_Comm )

3. Query and Migration callback function registration.
	- Can use Set_Callback_Fn(...) as the original Zoltan interface.
	- Use user-derived objects from 
	    Zoltan_MigrationObject
	    Zoltan_QueryObject
   Note: For version 1.1, add -DZOLTAN_OLD_CALLBACK to use this previous
         method.

4. Setup for Query and Migration Objects.
	- Create derived classes, implementing only the needed methods.
	- Instantiate derived object.
	- Register objects with Zoltan_LoadBalance object using
	    Set_QueryObject( Derived_QueryObject * )
	    Set_MigrationObject( Derived_MigrationObject * )

Version 1.1:

1. Query and Migration callback function registration.
        - Support for new function specific callback registration.

2. Zoltan interface changes.
	- Updated to support new zoltan interface including
	  (int *) ID's.
