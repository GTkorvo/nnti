Mike,

Thanks for  the update on the VBR and block Krylov work. It sounds
really good. I am sorry that I have not been able to talk 
with you about this and about the MPSalsa questions you 
raised about the LDRD work. Recently all I have ben doing si
working on SSI and combustion to represent Sandia. Things
have been busy, I have been up late many nights and am now
in DC attending a budget meeting. I hope this ends soon
I need to get my life back and do some real work..

Anyway, about the question at hand. In our work we have various 
chemical mechanisms which ahve differing number of species. The
number of unknows at a FE node can range from 1 to about 64 now
at the higher end. Specific sizes of interest include

unknowns                size
---------------------------------------
U,V,P                   3  - 2D fluids
U,V,W,P                 4  - 3D fluids
U,V,W,P,T               5  - 3D fluids with heat transfer
U,V,W,P,T,Yi            8  - 3D fluids with heat transfer, 3 species
                        12 - - 3D fluids with heat transfer, 7 species
                        16 - 3D fluids with heat transfer, 11 species
                        20 - 3D fluids with heat transfer, 15 species
                        24
                        32
                        36
                         .
                         .
                        64

Sorry you asked. Any way after some size there might be no benefit
from writing a special routine and not som many special cases
need to be coded. If you are considering aGordon Bell type
demo then we used a 19 species GaAs mechanism that produced
a 24 x 24 block. 

Let me know if you need more info. Hope all is well in MN.
