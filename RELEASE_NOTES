# Trilinos Release 5.0 Release Notes
#
################################################################################

Overview:

Trilinos is a collection of compatible software packages that support parallel 
linear algebra computations, solution of linear, non-linear and eigen systems 
of equations and related capabilities. The majority of packages are written in 
C++ using object-oriented techniques. All packages are self-contained, with the 
Trilinos top layer providing a common look-and-feel and infrastructure. 

Packages:

The version 5.0 general release contains 17 packages: Amesos, Anasazi, AztecOO, 
Didasko, Epetra, EpetraExt, Ifpack, Kokkos, Komplex, LOCA, ML, New_Package, 
NOX, Pliris, PyTrilinos, Teuchos, and Triutils.

The limited release contains an additional 5 packages that are available in 
special situations by request. These are: Belos, Claps, Jpetra, Meros, and 
Tpetra. 

Some of the significant new features:

- Four new packages: Anasazi (Eigensolvers), Didasko (Tutorial), Pliris
  (Distributed dense solvers), PyTrilinos (Python interface to Trilinos
  libraries).
- Trilinos tutorial delivered as part of a new package called Didasko.
- Kernel performance in Epetra substantially improved, especially for
  multiple rights.
- Initial kernel support for vector architectures in Epetra.
- Significant improvements and enhancements in most existing packages.

================================================================================

Amesos

- Improved handling of Epetra_RowMatrix operators 
- Memory leaks have been reduced 
- Simplified configuration using
    --with-libs=-L/home/kstanley/Trilinos3PL/lib
    --with-incdirs=-I/home/kstanley/Trilinos3PL/include
- Known bugs: 
  - Amesos_Dscpack has memory leaks, prints to standard out and may crash if 
    SymbolicFacgtorization() is called multiple times on the same Amesos 
    object. 
  - Amesos packages do not accept non-contiguous maps (e.g. one with indices 
    {1,2,5,8,9, ... } ) 
  - Superludist fails on some matrices 
  - Error handling on singular and near singular matrices is inconsistent 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anasazi (New)

- Anasazi framework includes abstract description of eigenproblem, eigensolver,
  sorting, and linear algebra. 
- Templated implementations of two block eigensolvers ( block Krylov-Schur and 
  block Davidson ) are included in this release. 
- Anasazi eigensolvers can use Epetra through linear algebra adapters. 
- A basic implementation of the abstract eigenproblem class is given for 
  solving standard and generalized eigenvalue problems. 
- A basic implementation of the abstract sorting class is given for the block 
  Krylov-Schur method. The block Davidson computes only the smallest 
  eigenvalues at this time. 
- Many examples for solving standard and generalized eigenvalues problems using 
  Anasazi are provided in this release. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AztecOO

- Robust support for multiple simultaneous instances of AztecOO objects.
  Prior releases had a very fragile memory management approach that require
  user intervention.
- Support (optional dependence on Teuchos) for ParameterList-driven use 
  of AztecOO via Teuchos ParameterList objects.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Didasko (New)

- Didasko now contains the tutorial PDF file and examples. All the tutorial 
  material is located in the Trilinos/packages/didasko subdirectory. 
- The doxygen documentation has been improved. 
- All examples are configured with autotools. Users can enable the compilations 
  of the examples by adding --enable-didasko to their configure line. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Epetra

- Memory efficiency improvement for MultiVector, CrsGraph and CrsMatrix 
  classes. 
- MultiVector uses much less O(NumVector) storage in important situations. 
- CrsGraph and CrsMatrix support a static profile mode that allows one-time 
  allocation of memory. 
- CrsGraph and CrsMatrix support a more robust OptimizeStorage capability that 
  improves memory use and performance. 
- Performance improvement for CrsMatrix and VbrMatrix kernels. 
- CrsMatrix matrix multiplication and triangular solves are 20% to 100% faster 
  that Version 4.0 
- VbrMatrix matrix multiplication is also improved for some important classes 
  of problems. 
- Initial vector architecture support for sparse matrix-vector multiplication. 
- A new class called JadOperator supports matrix-vector multiplication using 
  the so-called Jagged Diagonal data format. This format is especially 
  effective for vector machines such as the Cray X1 and NEC SX series machines.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
EpetraExt

- Scalable parallel distance-1 and distance-2 graph coloring. 
- Sparse matrix Add for Epetra CRS matrices. 
- Global index map "reindexing" tool for Epetra objects. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ifpack

- IFPACK 3.0 defines a general interface for preconditioners, through class 
  Ifpack_Preconditioner. 
- Class Ifpack_AdditiveSchwarz can be used to define general overlapping 
  one-level domain decomposition preconditioners. 
- IFPACK now offers point and block relaxation schemes, of Jacobi, 
  Gauss-Seidel, and symmetric Gauss-Seidel type. For block schemes, the 
  package supports both dense and sparse blocks. 
- Two new factorizations, ILUT and ICT, have been introduced. 
- A new user's guide is available. The doxygen documentation has been improved. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kokkos (version 1.1)

- No notable new features. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Komplex (version 2.0)

- No notable new features. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LOCA

- The LOCA library can now be built as a shared library using libtool. Known 
  issues with this are: 
  - Extra link libraries passed using the --with-libs configure flag should 
    use the "-Lpath -lname" format instead of "path/libname.a" 
  - Building LOCA as a static library on DEC architectures using template 
    repositories does not work. On these architectures, only build LOCA as a 
    shared library using the --enable-shared and --disable-static configure 
    flags, or turn off template repositories using the "-tweak" C++ compiler 
    flag. Note that if the later method is chosen, a large number of warnings 
    will be issued each time an executable is linked against LOCA. 
  - When building shared libraries on SGI systems in 64 bit, one must supply 
    the "-64" C++ compiler flag to not only the compiler and linker through 
    CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS, but also to libtool using LIBTOOL_CCLINKER_FLAGS 
    or --with-libtool-cclinker-flags. Also one must turn off template 
    repositories and the template prelinker using the flags "-ptused 
    -no_prelink -no_auto_include". 
  - When building shared libraries on Solaris systems, one should add 
    "-xlic_lib=sunperf" to CFLAGS, "-library=sunperf" to CXXFLAGS and 
    LIBTOOL_CCLINKER_FLAGS, and make sure neither of these flags appear in 
    LDFLAGS. 
  - A basic, but functional python interface to NOX and LOCA now exists. A 
    test exhibiting this functionality can be found in the 
    Trilinos/packages/nox/test/lapack/LOCA_python directory. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ML

- No notable new features. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New_Package (version 1.1)

- New tests are working examples of how to add tests to the Trilinos 
  Test-Harness. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOX

- A new Tensor based solver that is independent of the underlying linear 
  solver is now implemented (in the prerelease section). Previously the 
  Tensor method was hardwired to use an iterative solver. 
- Inexact Trust Region Techniques are fully supported (also in the prerelease 
  section). 
- Improved support for Epetra objects - The NOX::EpetraNew::Group should be 
  used in place of the NOX::Epetra::Group. In the future we will be phasing 
  out the NOX::Epetra::Group and replace it with NOX::EpetraNew::Group. 
- A multi-physics technique for code coupling has been demonstrated in the 
  test/epetra/Multiphysics directory. This will be expanded to a generic 
  capability in the next year. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pliris (New)

- An Object Oriented interface to a Dense Parallel LU Solver is now in place.
- The matrix is described in terms of Epetra Vectors and Multivectors.
- Multiple right hand sides can be addressed.
- Configure with --enable-pliris
- Test code allows performance studies - performance is dependent on highly 
  optimized Level 3 BLAS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PyTrilinos (New)

- Requires SWIG version 1.3.23 or higher (http://www.swig.org). 
- Requires python Numeric (http://www.pfdubois.com/numpy). 
- Configure with --enable-pytrilinos. 
- Currently provides access to Epetra, EpetraExt and NOX. From python, use 
  "from PyTrilinos import name", where "name" is the desired module. 
- Online documentation provides list of which classes have been wrapped. 
- Wrapped classes support almost all of the class methods. See documentation 
  of wrapped packages for details. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teuchos

- Additional BLAS/LAPACK wrappers 
- Teuchos::ScalarTraits template specializations for the GNU MP and Arprec 
  arbitrary precision libraries 
- Code enabling the conversion from NOX::Parameter::List to 
  Teuchos::ParameterList, and vice versa. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Triutils

- No notable new features.
