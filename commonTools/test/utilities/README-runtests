  This document describes the usage of runtests, the Trilinos test utility.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I.  Prerequisites

  In order for the test utility to work, you must have the following in place:
  
    1. You must have a working build directory.
    
    2. Your build directory must contain successfully built tests.
  
    3. Each package should have a well-formed definition file in 
       BUILD_DIR/packages/PACKAGE/test.
       
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
II.  Execution

  To execute the Trilinos test utility, simply type:
  
    cd /PATH/TO/Trilinos/test/
    runtests COMM BUILDDIR CATEGORY OUTPUTDIR
    
  where /PATH/TO/ is the absolute path to your top-level Trilinos directory, 
  COMM is "serial" or "mpi", BUILDDIR is the build directory, CATEGORY is the
  category of tests you would like run, and OUTPUTDIR is the directory in which
  the test results directory will be created (if this is omitted, . is
  assumed).  It is assumed that your build directory resides in your Trilinos
  directory.
    
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
III.  Test Results Directory

  The results of the tests will be placed in a new directory in the current
  working directory.  The directory will be named according to the following
  scheme:
  
    test_YR-MO-DA_HR.MN.SE/
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IV.  Test Results Files

  The results of the individual tests will be placed in the directory mentioned
  above and will be named according to the following scheme:
  
    PACKAGE_TEST_YR-MO-DA_HR.MN.SE.txt
    
  where PACKAGE is the name of the package and TEST is the name of the test.
  
  The test results files will consist of the following:
  
  +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  |HOST_NAME        = herouxsmp
  |DNS_NAME         = cs.csbsju.edu
  |HOST_OS          = linux
  |
  |TRILINOS_DIR     = /u/TrilinosTestHarness/TrilinosRelease5.0/Trilinos/
  |BRANCH           = trilinos-release-5-0-branch

  |BUILD_DIR        = SERIAL2/
  |COMM             = serial
  |
  |PACKAGE_DIR      = packages/epetra/
  |PACKAGE          = epetra

  |TEST_DIR         = Vector/
  |TEST             = ExecuteTestProblems.exe
  |TEST_REVISION    = 1.45
  |ARGUMENTS        = matrix1
  |
  |START_TIME       = 2005-03-31 16:40:23
  |END_TIME         = 2005-03-31 16:40:25
  |RUN_TIME         = 00:00:02
  |
  |EXIT_STATUS      = 0
  |RESULT           = pass
  |
  |BEGIN_TEST_OUTPUT
  |
  |  Hello, World.
  |  *** test passed ***
  |
  |END_TEST_OUTPUT
  |
