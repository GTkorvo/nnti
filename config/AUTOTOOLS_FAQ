Q1)  When I run bootstrap, I see warnings, "do not use m4_patsubst" and 
"do not use m4_regexp"

A1) The bootstrap should complete without any errors, however, at this
time it is not uncommon to have the following warnings:

configure.ac:63: warning: do not use m4_patsubst: use patsubst or m4_bpatsubst
configure.ac:341: warning: do not use m4_regexp: use regexp or m4_bregexp

These warnings will be fixed in the future.

Q2)  When I run configure in the build directory, it uses object code in 
the source directory.  

A2) If you wish to configure in a separate build directory (which is
highly recommended) you must not run configure or make in the source
directory.  If you have done so, you will have to get rid of all
conflicting files.  The only way that I know of to guarantee this is
to start from scratch (checkout a clean set of files and copy your
source files over).  In principle, "make distclean" should do this,
but I have mixed success with this.

Q3)  The compiler complains that PACKAGE is defined twice.

A3)  PACKAGE is defined in Epetra_config.h and also in
YourPackage_config.h.  Consider including YourPackage_config.h first
before any other include files.

Q4) Some systems offer <stdio> but not <stdio.h> others offer
<stdio.h> and not <stdio>.

A4) Do not include <Stdio> or <stdio.h> directly.  Include
Epetra_ConfigDefs.h (also included in almost any Epetra.*.h file)
