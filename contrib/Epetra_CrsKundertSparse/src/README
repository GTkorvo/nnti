To build the matrix solver driver, type 'make'.  You will need to modify
the makefile for non-SGI.

To run, type one of the follow 3 commands:

driver abs
driver ltra3
driver e1480

Each reads a different matrix.
The e1480 case will give some miscompares, which occur for a known reason.
This is because the initial ordering of the matrix is different from in
the running code that uotputted the matrix, and the reordering routine
is not deterministic (presumably to save time).  The errors look large
enough (in my opinion) to warrent a more conservative but slower reorder.

Anyway, the errors in e1480 are OK.

Trouble, questions or just want to talk?
