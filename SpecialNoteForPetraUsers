***********************  NOTE ************************************

1) Please note that Epetra supercedes Petra and you should make a switch
to Epetra at your earliest convenience.

2) To facilitate this process there is a SED script in the Trilinos/build
directory called Petra2Epetra.sed.  It does a very good job of
converting Petra-based code to Epetra-based code.  There is a "foreach" 
script in Trilinos/build that can be sourced to execute the
Petra2Epetra script on each file in a directory.  This foreach script
does the following in the current working directory:

- Creates two directories: "old" and "new".
- Then for each file (*.h *.cc *.cpp Makefile makefile) it:
- Copies the file to the "old" directory.
- Executes the sed script, putting a new version of the file in "new".
- Prints a "diff" of the old and new version of the file.


3) This process has been quite reliable in my experience.  The only thing
it does not handle is calls to a Petra_Comm constructor.  Epetra has
changed the meaning of the Comm class. Epetra_Comm is an abstract base
class.  Epetra_SerialComm, Epetra_MpiComm and Epetra_MpiSmpComm are
derived classes.  In order to get working code using Epetra Comm
classes, you must replace any Petra_Comm constructor calls with calls
to one of the three Epetra derived Comm classes.

Once you have run the SED scripts and modified the Comm class
constructor calls, there should be few or no other changes needed to
your code.
