#This script runs an mpi program on ASCI blue-pacific using

# Usage: run.poe <np> "executable [args]"
#
#note1: if your executable doesn't need any arguments, then you don't
#      need the quotes. If it does need arguments, then you do.
#      <np> is number-of-processors
#
#note2: this script does not make use of multiple procs per node. It
#       only grabs 1 proc on each node. For big jobs, don't use this
#       script.
