This directory contains test/example programs which exercise the
EPetra_ESI adaptor classes. Simply typing 'make' should build and
run all of the tests.

- Individual test executables may be built with:

  % gmake <file-base-name>.${TRILINOS_COMM}.x

  where <file-base-name> is the basename of the program source file,
  e.g., epetra_esi_object for epetra_esi_object.cpp.


- Once built, individual test executables may be run with:

  % ./run.mpi <np> <executable>

  where <np> is number-of-processors and <executable> is the particular
  executable you wish to run. (If the program is built in serial mode,
  then of course ./run.mpi is not necessary.)
