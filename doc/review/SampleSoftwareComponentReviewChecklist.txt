-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General Directions:
The process initiation date should be filled in immediately to initiate 
this process.  The initiation date must be the date of printing.  The indicated 
steps may be completed in any reasonable order.  The process shall 
be considered complete when all steps have been completed.

Specific Directions:
No specific form of review is required (i.e. Fagan Inspection).  The project 
leader shall determine the scope of the review (materials) and the method of 
conducting the review.  The module owner shall find reviewers and provide them 
with the applicable material.  The author of material may not be its reviewer.  
The method of conducting the review shall be the same for all reviewers for 
this checklist.  Evidence must be preserved showing the reviewers decision 
(Acceptable, Failed), materials examined,  and the date. A reviewer may review 
multiple categories.

This checklist is complete when the project leader determines its disposition.  
(The module review may be terminated early without completing all reviews to 
avoid wasted effort.)  The project leader may consult with the reviewers to 
determine the final disposition.
