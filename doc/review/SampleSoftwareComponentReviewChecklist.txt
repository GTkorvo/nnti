-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General Directions:
The process initiation date should be filled in immediately to initiate 
this process.  The initiation date must be the date of printing.  The indicated 
steps may be completed in any reasonable order.  The process shall 
be considered complete when all steps have been completed.

Specific Directions:
No specific form of review is required (i.e. Fagan Inspection).  The project 
leader shall determine the scope of the review (materials) and the method of 
conducting the review.  The module owner shall find reviewers and provide them 
with the applicable material.  The author of material may not be its reviewer.  
The method of conducting the review shall be the same for all reviewers for 
this checklist.  Evidence must be preserved showing the reviewers decision 
(Acceptable, Failed), materials examined,  and the date. A reviewer may review 
multiple categories.

This checklist is complete when the project leader determines its disposition.  
(The module review may be terminated early without completing all reviews to 
avoid wasted effort.)  The project leader may consult with the reviewers to 
determine the final disposition.

Process Ownership:
This document and associated procedure are owned by the  Project Leader who 
must approve any changes.  This document is version 1.0 and supercedes all 
previous versions.  This document is under version control.  
All previous versions will print with a banner "OBSOLETE".  

Authority to perform process:
Any team member may initiate this procedure. 

If this process or associated document is superceded after an activity has been 
initiated, the process shall be completed under this version unless 
specifically notified otherwise by the team leader.

Stage Entrance and Stage Exit:
The stage entrance is the process initiation by any authorized person.  
All necessary process inputs are build into the checklist.  The stage exit is 
the completion of this form (all steps completed and metrics 
entered.)  Note (see Specific Directions above), the project leader can 
terminate the process once the disposition can be determined to avoid wasted 
effort.
