\section{Iterative Solution of Linear Systems with AztecOO}
\label{chap:aztecoo}

AztecOO is package which extends the Aztec library~\cite{Aztec2.1}.
Aztec is the legacy iterative solver at the Sandia National
Laboratories.  It has been extracted from the MPSalsa reacting flow
code~\cite{MPSalsa-Theory,MPSalsa-User-Guide}, and it is currently
installed in dozens of Sandia's applications. AztecOO extends this
package, using C++ classes to enable more sophisticated uses.

AztecOO is intended for the iterative solution of linear systems of the
form
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:linear_sys}
  A \; X = B ,
\end{equation}
when $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is the linear system matrix, $X$
the solution, and $B$ the right-hand side. Although AztecOO can live
independently of Epetra, in this tutorial it is supposed that $A$ is an
Epetra\_RowMatrix, and both $X$ and $B$ are Epetra\_Vector or
Epetra\_MultiVector objects.

In this Chapter, we  will:
\begin{itemize}
\item Outline the basic issued of the iterative solution of linear
  systems (in Section~\ref{aztecoo:theoretical});
\item Present the basic usage of AztecOO (in
  Section~\ref{sec:basic_aztecoo});
\item Define one-level domain decomposition preconditioners (in
  Section~\ref{sec:aztecoo_dd});
\item Use of AztecOO problems as preconditioners to other AztecOO
  problems (in Section~\ref{sec:prec_aztecoo}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Theoretical Background}
\label{aztecoo:theoretical}

Aim of this Section is to briefly present some aspects of the iterative
solution of linear systems, to establish a notation. The Section is not
supposed to be exhaustive, nor complete on this subject. The reader is
referred to the existing literature for a rigorous presentation (see,
for instance, \cite{axelsson94iterative,saad96iterative}).

\medskip

One can distinguish between two different aspects of the iterative
solution of a linear system. The first one in the particular
acceleration technique for a sequence of iterations vectors, that is a
technique used to construct a new approximation for the solution, with
information from previous approximations.  This leads to specific
iteration methods, generally of Krylov type, such as conjugate gradient
or GMRES. The second aspect is the transformation of the given system to
one that can be more efficiently solved by a particular iteration
method. This is called {\em preconditioning}.  A good preconditioner
improves the convergence of the iterative method, sufficiently to
overcome the extra cost of its construction and application. Indeed,
without a preconditioner the iterative method may even fail to converge
in practice.

The convergence of iterative methods depends on the spectral properties
of the linear system matrix. The basic idea is to replace the original
system~(\ref{eq:linear_sys}) by
\[
P^{-1} A X = P^{-1} B
\]
(left-preconditioning), or by
\[
A P^{-1} P B = B
\]
(right-preconditioning), using a linear transformation $P^{-1}$,
called preconditioner, in order to improve the spectral properties of
the linear system matrix. In general terms, a preconditioner is any
kind of transformation applied to the original system which makes it
easier to solve.

In a modern perspective, the general problem of finding an efficient
preconditioner is to identify a linear operator $P$ with the following
properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $P$ is a good approximation of $A$ is some sense. Although no
  general theory is available, we can say that $P$ should act so that
  $P^{-1} A$ is near to being the identity matrix and its eigenvalues
  are clustered within a sufficiently small region of the complex plane;
\item $P$ is efficient, in the sense that the iteration method converges
  much faster, in terms of CPU time, for the preconditioned system.  In
  other words, preconditioners must be selected in such a way that the
  cost of constructing and using them is offset by the improved
  convergence properties they permit to achieve;
\item $P$ or $P^{-1}$ can take advantage of the architecture of modern
  supercomputers, that is, can be constructed and applied in parallel
  environments.
\end{enumerate}

It should be stressed that computing the inverse of $P$ is not
mandatory; actually, the role of $P$ is to ``preconditioning'' the
residual at step $m$, $r_m$, through the solution of the additional
system $P z_m = r_m$. This system $P z_m = {r}_m$ should be much easier
to solve than the original system.

\smallskip

The choice of $P$ varies from ``black-box'' algebraic techniques which
can be applied to general matrices to ``problem dependent''
preconditioners which exploit special features of a particular class
of problems. Although problem dependent preconditioners can be very
powerful, there is still a practical need for efficient
preconditioning techniques for large classes of problems. Between
these two extrema, there is a class of preconditioners which are
``general-purpose'' for a particular -- although large -- class of
problems.  These preconditioners are sometimes called ``gray-box''
preconditioners, since the user has to supply few information about
the matrix and the problem to be solved.

AztecOO itself implements a variety of preconditioners, from
``classical'' methods such as Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel, to polynomial and
domain-decomposition based preconditioners. More preconditioners can be
given to an AztecOO Krylov accelerator, by using the Trilinos packages
IFPACK and ML, covered in Chapter~\ref{chap:ifpack} and \ref{chap:ml},
respectively.

\subsection{Basic Usage}
\label{sec:basic_aztecoo}

To solve a linear system with AztecOO, one must create an
\verb!Epetra_LinearProblem!  object (see
Section~\ref{sec:linear_problem}) with the command
\begin{verbatim}
Epetra_LinearProblem Problem(&A,&x,&b);
\end{verbatim}
where \verb!A! is an Epetra matrix, and \verb!x,b! two Epetra
vectors\footnote{At the current stage of development, AztecOO does not
  take advantage of the Epetra\_MultiVectors. It accepts Multi\_Vectors,
  but it will solve the linear system corresponding to the first
  multivector only.}.  Then, the user must create an AztecOO object,
\begin{verbatim}
AztecOO Solver(Problem);
\end{verbatim}
and specify how to solve the linear system. All AztecOO options are set
using two vectors, \verb!options! (integer) and \verb!params! (double),
as detailed in the Aztec's User Guide.

To choose among the different AztecOO parameters, the user can create
two vectors, usually called \verb!options! and \verb!params!, set them
to the default values, and then override with the desired parameters:
Default values can be set by
\begin{verbatim}
int    options[AZ_OPTIONS_SIZE];
double params[AZ_PARAMS_SIZE];
AZ_defaults(options, params);
\end{verbatim}
followed by, for instance,
\begin{verbatim}
Solver.SetAllAztecOptions( options );
Solver.SetAllAztecParams( params );
\end{verbatim}
Those two functions will copy the values of \verb!options! and
\verb!params! in internal variables of the AztecOO object.

Alternatively, it is possible to set specific parameters without
creating \verb!options! and \verb!params!, using the AztecOO methods
\verb!SetAztecOption()! and \verb!SetAztecParams()!. 
For instance,
\begin{verbatim}
Solver.SetAztecOption( AZ_precond, AZ_Jacobi );
\end{verbatim}
to specify a point Jacobi preconditioner, and a tolerance of $10^{-12}$.
(We refer to the Aztec documentation for more details about the various
Aztec settings.)

To solve the linear system, with maximum number of 1550 iterations and a
tolerance of $1o^{-9}$, the user may call
\begin{verbatim}
Solver.Iterate(1550,1E-9);
\end{verbatim}
The complete code is in \TriExe{aztec/ex1.cpp}.

Note that the matrix must be in local form (that is, the command
\verb!A.FillComplete()! has been called before attempting to solve the
linear system).  Note also that the procedure to solve a linear system
with AztecOO is identical for sequential and parallel runs.  However
(for certain choices of the preconditioners), the convergence rate can
change as the number of processes used in the computation varies.

When this function returns, one can retrieve the number of iterations
performed by the linear solver using \verb!Solver.NumIters()!, while
\verb!Solver.TrueResidual()! gives the (nonscaled) norm the residual.

\subsection{One-level Domain Decomposition Preconditioners}
\label{sec:aztecoo_dd}

In this Section, we will consider preconditioners based on one-level
overlapping domain decomposition preconditioners, of the form
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:prec_dd}
  P^{-1} = \sum_{i=1}^M R_i^T \tilde{A}_i^{-1} R_i,
\end{equation}
where $P$ is the preconditioning operator, $M$ the number of subdomains.
$R_i$ is a rectangular matrix, composed by 0's and 1's, which restricts
a global vector to the subspace defined by the interior of each
subdomain, and $\tilde{A}_i$ is an approximation of
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:aztecoo_tilde_a}
  A_i = R_i A R_i^T .
\end{equation}
($\tilde{A}_i$ can be equal to $A_i$). Typically, $\tilde{A}_i$ differs
from $A_i$ when incomplete factorizations are used in (\ref{eq:prec_dd})
to apply $\tilde{A}_i^{-1}$, or when a matrix different from $A$ is used
in (\ref{eq:aztecoo_tilde_a}).

In order to use a preconditioner of the form (\ref{eq:aztecoo_tilde_a}),
the user has to specify
\begin{verbatim}
Solver.SetAztecOption( AZ_precond, AZ_dom_decomp );
\end{verbatim}
followed by the choice of incomplete factorization (and possibly with
that of corresponding parameters, for instance the level-of-fill),
\begin{verbatim}
Solver.SetAztecOption( AZ_subdomain_solve, AZ_ilu );
Solver.SetAztecOption( AZ_graph_fill, 1 );
\end{verbatim}
Exact subdomain solves can be used setting\footnote{AztecOO must be
  configured with the option {\tt --enable-aztecoo-azlu}, and the
  package Y12M is required.}
\begin{verbatim}
Solver.SetAztecOption( AZ_subdomain_solve, AZ_lu );
\end{verbatim}

By default, AztecOO will consider zero-overlap among the rows of
$A$\footnote{For point matrices arising from the FE discretization of
  the PDE problem with local functions, this is equivalent to one mesh
  element of overlap.}. However, this value of overlap can be changed by,
for instance,
\begin{verbatim}
Solver.SetAztecOption( AZ_overlap, 1 );
\end{verbatim}

\begin{remark} By using AztecOO in conjunction with ML, one can easily
  implement a two-level domain decomposition schemes. The reader is
  referred to Section~\ref{sec:ml_DD}.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark} Another Trilinos package can be used to compute
  incomplete factorizations, IFPACK. It is covered in
  Chapter~\ref{chap:ifpack}.
\end{remark}

\subsection{AztecOO Problems as Preconditioners}
\label{sec:prec_aztecoo}

AztecOO can accept Epetra\_Operator objects as preconditioners. This
means that any class, derived from Epetra\_Operator an implementing
method \verb!ApplyInverse()!, can be used in the preconditioning
phase. AztecOO itself can be used to define a preconditioner for
AztecOO, as class AztecOO\_Operator (which takes an AztecOO object in
the construction phase) is derived from Epetra\_Operator.

File \TriExe{aztecoo/ex2.cpp} shows how to use an AztecOO solver in the
preconditioning phase.  The main steps are here reported.

First, we have to specify the linear problem to be solved (set the
linear operator, the solution and the right-hand side), and create an
AztecOO object:
\begin{verbatim}
Epetra_LinearProblem A_Problem(&A, &x, &b);
AztecOO A_Solver(A_Problem);
\end{verbatim}
Now, we have to define the preconditioner. For the sake of simplicity,
we here suppose to use the same Epetra\_Matrix \verb!A! in the
preconditioning phase. However, the two matrices can in principle be
different (although of the same size).
\begin{verbatim}
Epetra_CrsMatrix P(A);
\end{verbatim}
(This operation is in general expensive as involves the copy
constructor.)  Then, we create the linear problem which will be used as
preconditioner.  This requires several steps.  (Note that all the
\verb!P! prefix identifies preconditioner' objects.)
\begin{enumerate}
\item We create the linear system solve at each prec step, and and we
  assign the linear operator (in this case, the matrix A itself)
\begin{verbatim}
Epetra_LinearProblem P_Problem;
P_Problem.SetOperator(&P);
\end{verbatim}
\item As we wish to use AztecOO to solve the prec step (in a recursive
  way), we have to define an AztecOO object:
\begin{verbatim}
AztecOO P_Solver(P_Problem);  
\end{verbatim}
\item Now, we customize certain parameters:
\begin{verbatim}
P_Solver.SetAztecOption(AZ_precond, AZ_Jacobi);
P_Solver.SetAztecOption(AZ_output, AZ_none);
P_Solver.SetAztecOption(AZ_solver, AZ_cg);
\end{verbatim}
\item The last step is to create an AztecOO\_Operator, so that we can set
  the Aztec's preconditioner with, and we set the user's defined
  preconditioners:
\begin{verbatim}
AztecOO_Operator
P_Operator(&P_Solver, 10);  
A_Solver.SetPrecOperator(&P_Operator);
\end{verbatim}
(Here 10 is the maximum number of iterations of the AztecOO solver in
the preconditioning phase.)
\item Finally, we solve the linear system:
\begin{verbatim}
int Niters=100;
A_Solver.SetAztecOption(AZ_kspace, Niters);
A_Solver.SetAztecOption(AZ_solver, AZ_gmres);
A_Solver.Iterate(Niters, 1.0E-12);  
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}


\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | p{5cm} | p{10cm} | }
\hline
\verb!AZ_cg! & Conjugate gradient (only applicable to symmetric positive
definite matrices). \\
\verb!AZ_cg_condnum! & As \verb!AZ_cg!, but also estimates the condition
number of the preconditioned linear operator. \\
\verb!AZ_gmres! & Restarted generalized minimal residual (returned in
\verb!params[AZ_condnum]!). \\ 
\verb!AZ_gmres_condnum! & As \verb!AZ_gmres!, but also estimates the condition
number of the preconditioned linear operator  (returned in
\verb!params[AZ_condnum]!). \\ 
\verb!AZ_cgs! &  Conjugate gradient squared.\\
\verb!AZ_tfqmr! & Transpose-free quasi minimal residual. \\
\verb!AZ_bicgstab! &  Bi-conjugate gradient with stabilization.\\
\verb!AZ_lu! & Sparse direct solver (one process only). This requires
AztecOO to be configured with {\tt --enable-aztecoo-azlu}. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Avialable choices for {\tt options[AZ\_solver]}.}
\label{tab:aztec:solver}
\end{center}
\end{table}

An example of the performances of AztecOO preconditioners is reported in
Table~\ref{tab:aztecoo:dd}. The table reports the estimated condition
number of one-level Schwarz preconditioner with mininal overlap. The
problem is a 2D Laplace operator, discretized using a 5-point formula on
a regular Cartesian grid. As predicted by theory, the condition number
is linear $\mathcal{O}(1/hH)$, where $h$ is the mesh size, and $H$ is
the size of each (square) subdomain.

File \TriExe{aztecoo/ex3.cpp} reports the code used to obtain these
retults. The code uses the Trilinos\_Util\_CrsMatrixGallery class to
create the matrix. For instance, to estimate the condition number with
$h=1/60$ and $H=1/3$, one may have:
\begin{verbatim}
[msala:aztecoo]> mpirun -np 9 ex3.exe -problem_type=laplace_2d \
                 -problem_size=900 -map_type=box
\end{verbatim}

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{| c | c c c |}
    \hline
    & $h=1/30$ & $h=1/60$ & $h=1/120$ \\
    \hline
    $H=1/3$ & 40.01 & 83.80 & 183.41 \\
    $H=1/4$ & 51.46 & 106.01 & 223.22 \\
    $H=1/6$ & 79.19 & 15040 & 311.26 \\
    $H=1/8$ & -     & 191.06 & 403.29 \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Condition number for one-level domain decomposition precondititoner on a square.}
  \label{tab:aztec:dd}
\end{table}

\subsection{Concluding Remarks on AztecOO}

The following methods are often used:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb!NumIters()! returns the total number of iterations performed
  on {\sl this} problem;
\item \verb!TrueResidal()! returns the true unscaled residual;
\item \verb!ScaledResidual()! returns the unscaled residual;
\item \verb!SetAztecDefaults()! can be used to restore default values in
  the options and params vectors.
\end{itemize}

The official documentation of AztecOO can be found in
\cite{AztecOO-Users-Guide}.
