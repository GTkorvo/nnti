\section{Reading a HB problem}

It is possible to read matrix, solution and right-hand side, from a file
written in the Harwell/Boeing format. This is done in
\TriExe{triutils/ex1.cpp}. The key instructions are the following.

First, we define pointers to Epetra\_Vector and Epetra\_Matrix objects:
\begin{verbatim}
Epetra_Map * readMap; // Pointers because of Trilinos_Util_ReadHb2Epetra
Epetra_CrsMatrix * readA; 
Epetra_Vector * readx; 
Epetra_Vector * readb;
Epetra_Vector * readxexact;
\end{verbatim}
The HB problem is read with the instruction
\begin{verbatim}
Trilinos_Util_ReadHb2Epetra(FileName, Comm, readMap, readA, readx, 
                            readb, readxexact);   
\end{verbatim}
Note that this has created an Epetra\_Matrix and two Epetra\_Vectors,
with all the elements assigned to processor zero. This is because the HB
file does not contain any information about the distribution of the
elements to the processors. To solve the linear problem in parallel, the
user must specify a map.  For instance, we can use a linear map:
\begin{verbatim}
int NumGlobalElements = readMap->NumGlobalElements();
Epetra_Map map(NumGlobalElements,0,Comm);
\end{verbatim}
and create and exporter to distribute read-in matrix and vectors:
\begin{verbatim}
Epetra_Export exporter(*readMap, map);
Epetra_CrsMatrix A(Copy, map, 0);
Epetra_Vector x(map);
Epetra_Vector b(map);
Epetra_Vector xexact(map);
// this is the data distribution phase
x.Export(*readx, exporter, Add);
b.Export(*readb, exporter, Add);
xexact.Export(*readxexact, exporter, Add);
A.Export(*readA, exporter, Add);
\end{verbatim}
Finally, we can destroy the objects used to store the non-distributed HB
problem:
\begin{verbatim}
delete readA;
delete readx;
delete readb;
delete readxexact;
delete readMap;
\end{verbatim}

\section{ShellOptions}

ShellOptions is a class to manage the input arguments and shell
variables.  With this class, it is easy to handle input line arguments
and shell variables. For instance, the user can write 
\begin{verbatim}
$ ./a.out -nx 10 -tol 1e-6 -solver=cg 
\end{verbatim}
and then easily retrieve the value of {\tt nx}, {\tt tol}, and {\tt solver}.
 
A simple code using this class is as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{

  ShellOptions Args(argc,argv);
  int nx = Args.GetIntOption("-nx", 123);
  int ny = Args.GetIntOption("-ny", 145);
  double tol = Args.GetDoubleOption("-tol", 1e-12);
  string solver = Args.GetIntOption("-solver");

  cout << "nx = " << nx << endl;
  cout << "ny = " << ny << " (default value)" << endl;
  cout << "tol = " << tol << endl;
  cout << "solver = " << solver << endl;

  return 0;
}
\end{verbatim}

Each line   option can have a value or not. For options with a value,
the user can specify this values as follows. Let \verb!-tolerance! be the
name of the option and \verb!1e-12! its value. Both choices are valid:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb!-tolerance 1e-12! (with one or more spaces)
\item \verb!-tolerance=1e-12! (with \verb!=! sign and no spaces)
\end{itemize}

Option names must begin with one or more dashes (`\verb!-!'). Each option
cannot have more than one value.

To use this class, the user has to build the database using the 
\verb!argc,argv! input arguments. Then, to retrieve the option value, the user
 has to use one of the following functions:
\verb!GetIntOption!, \verb!GetDoubleOption!, and \verb!GetStringOption!.
 
If option name is not found in the database, a value of 0, 0.0 or an
 empty string is returned. If needed, the user can also specify a
 default value to return when the option name is not found in the
 database. Method \verb!HaveOption! can be used to query the database for
 an option.

File \TriExe{triutils/ex2.cpp} gives an example of the usage of this class.
