\subsection{Getting Started}
\label{sec:getting}

The Trilinos framework uses a two level software structure that connects
a system of {\sl packages}. A Trilinos package is an integral unit,
usually developed to solve a specific task, by a (relatively) small
group of experts.  Packages exist beneath the Trilinos top level,
which provides a common look-and-feel. Each package has its own
structure, documentation and set of examples, and it is possibly
available independently of Trilinos. However, each package is even more
valuable when combined with other Trilinos packages.

\smallskip

Trilinos is a large software project, and currently about twenty
packages are included.  The entire set of packages covers a wide range
of numerical methods for large scale computing, as well as a large set
of utilities to improve the development of software for scientific
computing. 

Clearly, a full understanding all the functionalities of the Trilinos
packages requires time.  Each package offers sophisticated features,
difficult to ``unleash'' at a first sight.  Besides that, a detailed
description of each Trilinos package is beyond the scope of this
document. Instead, the tutorial ensures that users have the background
to make good use of the extensive documentation contained in each
package. Initially, it is important to understand how to manipulate the
basic classes, such as vector, matrix and linear system classes.
%For a
%successive fine-tuning phase, users still must look through individual
%package's documentation and examples.

\medskip

We will describe the following subset of the Trilinos packages.
\begin{itemize} 
\item {\bf Epetra}. The package defines the basic classes for
  distributed matrices and vectors, linear operators and linear
  problems. Epetra classes are the common language spoken by all the
  Trilinos packages (even if some packages can ``speak'' other
  languages). Each Trilinos package accepts as input Epetra objects.
  This allows powerful combinations among the various Trilinos
  functionalities.
\item {\bf Triutils}. This is a collection of utilities that are useful
  in software development. Here, we present a command line parser and a
  matrix generator, that are used throughout this document to define
  example matrices.
\item {\bf AztecOO}. This is a linear solve package based on
  preconditioned Krylov methods. Aztec users will find that AztecOO
  supports all the Aztec interfaces and functionality, and also provides
  significant new functionality.
\item {\bf IFPACK}. The package performs various incomplete
  factorizations, and is here used with AztecOO.
\item {\bf Teuchos}. This is a collection of classes that can be
  essential for advanced code development. A Teuchos class can be used
  to define ML and Amesos objects.
\item {\bf ML}. The algebraic multilevel and domain decomposition
  preconditioner package provides scalable preconditioning capabilities
  for a variety of problem classes. It is here used as a preconditioner
  for AztecOO solvers.
\item {\bf Amesos}. The package provides a common interface to certain
  sparse direct linear solvers (generally available outside the Trilinos
  framework), both sequential and parallel.
\item {\bf Anasazi}. The package provides a common interface to
  parallel eigenvalues and eigenvectors solvers, for both symmetric and
  non-symmetric linear problems.
\item {\bf NOX}. This is a collection of nonlinear solvers, designed to
  be easily integrated into an application and used with many different
  linear solvers.
\end{itemize}

Table~\ref{tab:tripackages} gives a partial overview of what can be
accomplished using Trilinos.

\end{table}

\begin{remark}
  As already pointed out, Epetra objects are meant to be the ``common
  language'' spoken by all the Trilinos packages, and are a natural
  starting point. For new users, Chapters
  \ref{chap:epetra_vec}-\ref{chap:epetra_others} are a prerequisite to
  the later chapters. Chapters~\ref{chap:triutils} is not essential to
  understand Trilinos, but the functionalities there presented are used
  in this document as a starting point for many examples.  One of the
  classes described in Chapter~\ref{chap:teuchos}, the
  Teuchos\_ParameterList, is later used in Chapters~\ref{chap:ml} and
  \ref{chap:amesos}.  Chapter~\ref{chap:aztecoo} should be read before
  Chapters~\ref{chap:ifpack} and~\ref{chap:ml} (even if both IFPACK and
  ML can be compiled and run without AztecOO).
\end{remark}

The only prerequisites assumed in this tutorial are some familiarities
with numerical methods for PDEs, and with iterative linear and nonlinear
solvers. Although not strictly necessary, the reader is assumed to have
some familiarity with distributed memory computing and, to a lesser
extent, with MPI\footnote{Although almost no explicit MPI instructions
  are required in a Trilinos code, the reader should be aware of the
  basic concepts of message passing, like the definition of a
  communicator.}.

\smallskip

Note that this tutorial is not a substitute for individual packages'
documentation. Also, for an overview of all the Trilinos packages, the
Trilinos philosophy, and a description of the packages provided by
Trilinos, the reader is referred to \cite{Trilinos-Overview}.
Developers should also consider the Trilinos Developers' Guide, which
addresses many topics, including the development tools used by Trilinos'
developers, and a description of how to include a new package\footnote{
  Trilinos provides a variety of services to a developer wanting to
  integrate a package into Trilinos.  The services include
  Autoconf~\cite{Autoconf}, Automake~\cite{Automake} and
  Libtool~\cite{Libtool}. The tools provide a robust, full-featured set
  of tools for building software across a broad set of platforms.  The
  tools are not officially standards, but are widely used.  All existing
  Trilinos packages use Autoconf and Automake.  Libtool support will be
  added in future releases.}.

\subsection{Installation}
\label{sec:installing}

To obtain Trilinos, please follow the instructions at the web site
\begin{verbatim}
http://software.sandia.gov/Trilinos
\end{verbatim}

Trilinos has been compiled on a variety of architectures, including
various flavors of Linux, Sun Solaris, SGI Irix, DEC, ASCI Red, and many
others. Trilinos has been designed to support parallel applications.
However, it also compiles and runs on serial computers.  Detailed
comments on the installation, and an exhaustive list of FAQs, may be
found at the web pages:
\begin{verbatim}
http://software.sandia.gov/Trilinos/installing_manual.html
http://software.sandia.gov/Trilinos/faq.html
\end{verbatim}

After obtaining Trilinos, the next step is its compilation. The
description here is for LINUX platforms with MPI.

We strongly recommend that the user set the environmental variables
\verb!TRILINOS_HOME!, indicating the full path of the Trilinos
directory, \verb!TRILINOS_LIB!, indicating the location of the compiled
Trilinos library, and \verb!TRILINOS_ARCH!, containing the architecture
and the communicator currently used.  For example, using the BASH shell,
command lines of the form
\begin{verbatim}
export TRILINOS_HOME=/home/msala/Trilinos
export TRILINOS_ARCH=LINUX.MPI
export TRILINOS_LIB=${TRILINOS_HOME}/${TRILINOS_ARCH}
\end{verbatim}
can be places in the users' \verb!.bashrc! file.

\smallskip

Each Trilinos' package can be enabled or disabled at configuration time.
A procedure one may follow in order to compile Trilinos with AztecOO,
ML, IFPACK, Anasazi, NOX, and Triutils is reported below. \$ indicates the
shell prompt. The \verb!tee! command is used to write the output to
standard output and to the specified file, and may be omitted.  More
details about the installation of Trilinos can be found in
\cite{Trilinos-Users-Guide}.
\begin{verbatim}
$ cd ${TRILINOS_HOME}
$ mkdir ${TRILINOS_ARCH}
$ cd ${TRILINOS_ARCH}
$ ../configure --prefix=${TRILINOS_HOME}/${TRILINOS_ARCH} \
  --enable-mpi --with-mpi-compilers \
  --enable-triutils --enable-aztecoo \
  --enable-ifpack --enable-anasazi \
  --enable-ml --enable-nox  --enable-teuchos \
  --enable-nox-epetra | tee configure_${TRILINOS_ARCH}.log
$ make | tee make_${TRILINOS_ARCH}.log
$ make install | tee make_install_${TRILINOS_ARCH}.log
\end{verbatim}
For serial configuration, set
\begin{verbatim}
export TRILINOS_ARCH=LINUX.SERIAL
\end{verbatim}
and delete the \verb!--enable-mpi --with-mpi-compilers! options.
\begin{remark}
  All Trilinos packages can be build to run with or without MPI. If MPI
  is enabled (using \verb!--enable-mpi!), the users must know the
  procedure for beginning MPI jobs on their computer system(s). It may be
  necessary to specify on the configure line the location of MPI include
  files and libraries.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  Compiling Trilinos requires time! For instance, on a Pentium 4, 1.7
  Ghz with Intel compilers, to configure Trilinos with LOCA, NOX,
  AztecOO, Anasazi, IFPACK, Triutils, EpetraExt, Teuchos, ML and Epetra,
  required 2 minutes and 11 seconds. The compilation took 5 minutes and
  41 seconds. The reader is encouraged to start by enabling a limited
  number of packages, then re-configuring Trilinos as required.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Compiling and Linking a program using Trilinos}
\label{sec:intro_compiling}

In order to compile and link a code that makes use of Trilinos, the user
may decide to use a Makefile similar to the one reported below.  Suppose
that our code requires Epetra, AztecOO and IFPACK, and that the
procedure outlined in Section~\ref{sec:installing} has been followed.
The UNIX makefile can be as follows (line number are reported for
reader's convenience):
\begin{verbatim}
 1: TRILINOS_HOME = /home/msala/Trilinos/
 2: TRILINOS_ARCH - LINUX_MPI
 3: TRILINOS_LIB = $(TRILINOS_HOME)$(TRILINOS_ARCH)
 4: 
 5: include $(TRILINOS_HOME)/build/makefile.$(TRILINOS_ARCH)
 6: 
 7: MY_COMPILER_FLAGS = -DHAVE_CONFIG_H $(CXXFLAGS) -c -g\
 8:                    -I$(TRILINOS_LIB)/include/
 9:
10: MY_LINKER_FLAGS = $(LDFLAGS) $(TEST_C_OBJ) \
11:         -L$(TRILINOS_LIB)/lib/ \
12:         -lifpack -laztecoo -lepetra $(ARCH_LIBS)
14:
15: ex1: ex1.cpp
16:         $(CXX)     ex1.cpp $(MY_COMPILER_FLAGS)
17:         $(LINKER)  ex1.o   $(MY_LINKER_FLAGS)    -o ex1.exe
\end{verbatim}
Here we assume that the reader knows about UNIX makefiles.  Line 5
includes basic definitions of Trilinos. (On some architectures, one may
need to use \verb!gmake! instead of \verb!make!.)  In line 7, the
variable \verb!HAVE_CONFIG_H! is defined.  This definition is extremely
important, and must not be omitted.  Linker flags of lines 10-13 define
the library to link (other libraries may be needed).  The variable
\verb!ARCH_LIBS! is defined in line 5.

In this example, the name of the executable is \verb!ex1.exe!.  The
command to run this example on 2 processors is often
\begin{verbatim}
[msala:epetra]> mpirun -np 2 ./ex1.exe
\end{verbatim}
Please check the local MPI documentation for more details.

\subsection{Programming Language Used in this Tutorial}
\label{sec:language}

Trilinos is written in C++ (for most packages), and in C. Some
interfaces are provided to FORTRAN codes (mainly BLAS and LAPACK
routines). Even if limited support is included for C programs (and a
more limited for FORTRAN code), to unleash the full power of Trilinos we
recommend C++. All the example programs contained in this tutorial are
in C++; some packages (like ML) contain examples in C.
