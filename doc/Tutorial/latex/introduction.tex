\chapter{Introduction}

The Trilinos Project is an effort to facilitate the design, development,
integration and ongoing support of mathematical software libraries. In
particular, the goal of the Trilinos Project is develop parallel solver
algorithms and libraries within an object-oriented software framework
for the solution of large-scale, complex multiphysics engineering and
scientific applications. The emphasis is on developing robust, scalable
algorithm in a software framework, using abstract interfaces for
flexible interoperability of components while providing a full-featured
set of concrete classes that implement all abstract interfaces.

\section{Getting Started with Trilinos}
\label{sec:getting}

The Trilinos Project uses a two-level software structure designed around
collections of packages. A Trilinos package is an integral unit, usually
developed to solve a specific task, by a (relatively) small group of
expert of the field.  Packages exist underneath the Trilinos top level,
which provides a common look-and-feel. Each package has its own
structure, documentation and set of examples. In principle, Trilinos
packages can independent life. However, each package is even more
valuable when combined with other Trilinos packages.

\smallskip

Trilinos is a large software project, an currently mode about twenty
packages are included. Fully understanding all the functionalities of
the Trilinos packages requires time. The entire set of packages covers a
wide range of numerical methods for large scale computing. Some packages
are focused on the development of computational schemes, like for
instance the solution of linear and nonlinear systems, to the definition
of parallel preconditioners for Krylov methods, eigenvalue computation.
Other packages are more focused on implementation issues (like
definition of matrices and vectors, abstract classes for linear
operators). The first Chapters of this tutorial will be focused on
implementation issues, while the last Chapters will have a more
``mathematical'' taste. 

Each package offers sophisticated features, that cannot be ``unleashed''
at a very first usage. For each package, wew will outline only the basic
features, and we refer to the documentation of each package for a more
involved usage. Our goal is to present enough material so that the
reader can successfully use the described packages.  In fact, for new
users, it is not easy, nor necessary, to manage all the Trilinos
functionalities. At the beginning, it is more important for them to
understand how to manage the basic classes, as vector, matrices and
linear systems classes. However, it is clear that for a fine-tuning, the
reader will have to look through each package's documentation and
examples.

\medskip

Although all packages have the same importance
in the Trilinos structure, a ``normal'' user will probably --- at least
at the beginning --- make use of the following packages:
\begin{itemize} 
\item {\bf Epetra}. This package defines the basic classes for
  distributed matrices and vectors, linear operators and linear
  problems. Epetra classes are the common language spoken by all the
  Trilinos packages (even if some of them can ``speak'' other
  languages). Each Trilinos package is able to accept in input Epetra
  objects. This allows powerful combinations among the various Trilinos
  functionalities.
\item {\bf AztecOO}. This is a linear solve package based on preconditioned
  Krylov methods. It supports all the  Aztec interfaces and
  functionality, but also provided significant new functionality.
\item {\bf IFPACK}. This is a package to perform various incomplete
  factorizations, and it is here used in conjunction with AztecOO.
\item {\bf ML}. This is an algebraic multilevel preconditioned package, which
  provided scalable preconditioning capabilities for a variety of
  problem classes. It is here used in conjunction with AztecOO.
\item {\bf Amesos}. This package provides a common interface to various
  direct solvers (generally available outside the Trilinos framework),
  both sequential and parallel.
\item {\bf NOX}. This is a collection of nonlinear solvers, designed to
  be easily integrated into an application and used with many different
  linear solvers.
\item {\bf Triutils}. This is a collection of various utilities, that
  can be extremely useful in some phases of software development.
\end{itemize}

Table~\ref{tab:tripackages} gives a partial overview of what can be
accomplished using Trilinos.

  \caption{Partial overview of what can be done with Trilinos. $\star$:

  \label{tab:tripackages}
\end{table}

This tutorial is divided into 7 chapters:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Chapter \ref{chap:epetra_vec} describes the Epetra\_Vector class;
\item Chapter \ref{chap:epetra_mat} introduces the Epetra\_Matrix
  class; 
\item Chapter \ref{chap:epetra_others} briefly describes some other
  Epetra classes;
\item Chapter \ref{chap:aztecoo} shows how to solve linear systems with
  AztecOO;
\item Chapter \ref{chap:ifpack} presents the basic usage of IFPACK;
\item Chapter \ref{chap:ml} introduces multilevel preconditioners based
  on ML;
\item Chapter \ref{chap:amesos} introduces the Amesos package;
\item Chapter \ref{chap:nox} outlines the main features of the Trilinos
  nonlinear solver package, NOX.
\item Chapter \ref{chap:triutils} presents some tools provided with the
  Triutils package. 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{remark}
  As already pointed out, Epetra objects are meant to be the ``common
  language'' spoken by all the Trilinos packages, and therefore the new
  user must become familiar with those objects. Therefore we suggest to
  read Chapters \ref{chap:epetra_vec}-\ref{chap:epetra_others} before
  considering other Trilinos packages. Also, Chapter~\ref{chap:aztecoo}
  should be read before Chapters~\ref{chap:ifpack} and~\ref{chap:ml}
  (even if both IFPACK and ML can be compiled and run without AztecOO).
\end{remark}

This tutorial assume a basic background in numerical methods for PDEs,
and in iterative linear and nonlinear solvers. Although not strictly
necessary, the reader is suppose to have a certain familiarity with
distributed memory computing and, to a minor extent, with MPI.

\smallskip

Note that this tutorial is not a substitute of other packages'
documentation. In particular, for an overview of all the Trilinos
packages, the Trilinos philosophy, and a description of the packages
provided by Trilinos, the reader is referred to
\cite{Trilinos-Overview}.  Developers should also consider the Trilinos
Developers' Guide, which contains, among others, some insight of the
development tools used by Trilinos' developers, and how to include a new
package\footnote{ Trilinos provides a variety of services to a developer
  wanting to integrate a package into Trilinos.  They include
  Autoconf~\cite{Autoconf}, Automake~\cite{Automake} and
  Libtool~\cite{Libtool} provide a robust, full-featured set of tools
  for building software across a broad set of platforms.  Although these
  tools are not official standards, they are widely used.  All existing
  Trilinos packages use Autoconf and Automake.  Libtool support will be
  added in future releases.}.

\section{Installing Trilinos}
\label{sec:installing}

To obtain Trilinos, please refers to the instructions reported at the
following web site:
\begin{verbatim}
http://software.sandia.gov/
\end{verbatim}

Trilinos has been compiled on a variety of architectures, including
Linux, Sun Solaris, SGI Irix, DEC, and many others. Trilinos has been
designed to support parallel applications. However, it can be compiled
and run on serial computer.  Detailed comments on the installation, and
an exhaustive list of FAQs, can be found at the web pages:
\begin{verbatim}
http://software.sandia.gov/Trilinos/installing_manual.html
http://software.sandia.gov/Trilinos/faq.html
\end{verbatim}


Before using Trilinos, users might decide to set the environmental
variables \verb!TRILINOS_HOME!, indicating the full path of the Trilinos
directory, \verb!TRILINOS_LIB!, indicating the location of the compiled
Trilinos library, and \verb!TRILINOS_ARCH!, containing the architecture
and the communicator currently used.  For example, using the BASH shell,
command lines of the form
\begin{verbatim}
export TRILINOS_HOME=/home/msala/Trilinos
export TRILINOS_ARCH=LINUX.MPI
export TRILINOS_LIB=${TRILINOS_HOME}/${TRILINOS_ARCH}
\end{verbatim}
can be places in the users' \verb!.bashrc! file.

\smallskip

Here, we briefly report the procedure one should follow in order to
compile Trilinos as required by the examples reported in the following
chapters \ref{chap:epetra_vec}-\ref{chap:triutils}\footnote{Amesos can
  be more difficult to compile for the unexperienced user, as it
  required some information about the packages to interface. Suggestions
  about the configuration of Amesos are reported in
  Chapter~\ref{chap:amesos}. More details about the installation of
  Trilinos can be found in \cite{Trilinos-Users-Guide}.}.

We suppose to compile under LINUX with MPI. The installation procedure
can be are reported below. (\verb!$! indicates the shell prompt.)
\begin{verbatim}
$ cd ${TRILINOS_HOME}
$ mkdir ${TRILINOS_ARCH}
$ cd ${TRILINOS_ARCH}
$ ../configure --prefix="${TRILINOS_HOME}/${TRILINOS_ARCH}" \
  --enable-mpi --with-mpi-compilers \
  --enable-triutils --enable-aztecoo \
  --enable-ifpack \
  --enable-ml --enable-nox | tee configure_${TRILINOS_ARCH}.log
$ make | tee make_${TRILINOS_ARCH}.log
$ make install | tee make_install_${TRILINOS_ARCH}.log
\end{verbatim}

\begin{remark}
  All Trilinos packages can be build to run with or without MPI. If MPI
  is enabled (using \verb!--enable-mpi!), the users must know the
  procedure for beginning MPI jobs on their computer system(s). In some
  cases, options must be set in the configure line to specify the
  location of MPI include files and libraries.
\end{remark}

\section{Compiling and Linking a program using Trilinos}
\label{sec:intro_compiling}

In order to compile and link (part of) the Trilinos library, the use can
decide to use a Makefile as reported below. This Makefile refers to one
of the examples, reported in the NOX subdirectory of this tutorial.
\begin{verbatim}
 1: TRILINOS_HOME = /home/msala/Trilinos/
 2: TRILINOS_ARCH - LINUX_MPI
 3: TRILINOS_LIB = $(TRILINOS_HOME)$(TRILINOS_ARCH)
 4: 
 5: include $(TRILINOS_HOME)/build/makefile.$(TRILINOS_ARCH)
 6: 
 7: MY_COMPILER_FLAGS = -DHAVE_CONFIG_H $(CXXFLAGS) -c -g\
 8:                    -I$(TRILINOS_LIB)/include/
 9:
10: MY_LINKER_FLAGS = $(LDFLAGS) $(TEST_C_OBJ) \
11:         -L$(TRILINOS_LIB)/lib/ \
12:         -lnoxepetra -lnox -lifpack \
13:         -laztecoo -lepetra -llapack -lblas $(ARCH_LIBS)
14:
15: ex1: ex1.cpp
16:         $(CXX)     ex1.cpp $(MY_COMPILER_FLAGS)
17:         $(LINKER)  ex1.o   $(MY_LINKER_FLAGS)    -o ex1.exe
\end{verbatim}

Line number have been reported for  reader's convenience. 

The lines 1-3 can be omitted, see Section \ref{sec:installing}.  Line 5
includes basic definitions of Trilinos. (Note that, on some
architectures, one may need to use \verb!gmake! instead of \verb!make!.)
In line 7, the variable \verb!HAVE_CONFIG_H! is defined. Linker flags of
lines 10-13 defines the library to link (location of BLAS and LAPACK can
change on different platforms). The variable \verb!ARCH_LIBS! is defined
in line 5.

To run the compiled example in a sequential environment, simply type
\begin{verbatim}
$ ./ex2.exe
\end{verbatim}
In a MPI environment, the user might have to
use an instruction of type
\begin{verbatim}
$ mpirun -np 2 ./ex1.exe
\end{verbatim}
Please check the local MPI documentation for more details.

\section{Programming Language Used in this Tutorial}
\label{sec:language}

Trilinos is written in C++ (for most packages), and in C. Some
interfaces are provided to FORTRAN code (mainly BLAS and LAPACK
routines). Even if a limited support is included for C programs (and a
more limited for FORTRAN code), to unleashed the full power of Trilinos
we suggest to use C++. All the example programs contained in this
tutorial will be in C++; some packages contains examples in C.

equal). As a general line, source files are in
\begin{verbatim}
${TRILINOS_HOME}/packages/<package-name>/src
\end{verbatim}
Example files are reported in \begin{verbatim}
${TRILINOS_HOME}/packages/<package-name>/examples

${TRILINOS_HOME}/packages/<package-name>/test
\end{verbatim}
The documentation is reported
\begin{verbatim}
${TRILINOS_HOME}/packages/<package-name>/doc
\end{verbatim}
Often, Trilinos developers use Doxygen\footnote{Copyright \copyright
  1997-2003 by Dimitri van Heesch. More information can by found at the
  web address {\tt http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/}.}. For
instance, to create the documentation for Epetra, we use can type
\begin{verbatim}
$ cd ${TRILINOS_HOME}/packages/epetra/doc
$ doxygen Doxyfile
\end{verbatim}
and then browse it using an HTML reader, or compiling the \LaTeX file
using
