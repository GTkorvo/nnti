\section{Other Epetra Classes}
\label{chap:epetra_others}

Epetra includes a certain number of classes that can greatly help the
development of parallel codes. In this Chapter we will recall the main
usage of some of those classes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Epetra\_Time (in Section \ref{sec:time});
\item Epetra\_Flops (in Section \ref{sec:flops}).
\item Epetra\_Operator and Epetra\_RowMatrix (in Section \ref{sec:operator});
\item Epetra\_LinearProblem (in Section \ref{sec:linear_problem}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Epetra\_Time}
\label{sec:time}

To retrieve elapsed and wall-clock time can be problematic because of
several platform-dependent and language-dependent issues. To avoid those
problems, Epetra furnishes the Epetra\_Time class.  Epetra\_Time is
meant to insulate the user from the specifics of timing among a variety
of platforms.  Using Epetra\_Time, it is possible to measure the elapsed
time. This is the time elapsed between two phases of a program.

An Epetra\_Time object is defined as
\begin{verbatim}
Epetra_Time time(Comm);
\end{verbatim}
(\verb!Comm! being an Epetra\_Comm object, see Section~\ref{sec:comm}.)
To compute the elapsed time required by a given piece of code, then user
should put the instruction
\begin{verbatim}
time.ResetStartTime();
\end{verbatim}
before the code to be timed. \verb!ElapsedTime()!  returns the elapsed
time from the creation of {\sl this} object or from the last call to
\verb!ResetStartTime()!.

\subsection{Epetra\_Flops}
\label{sec:flops}

The Epetra\_Flops class provides basic support and consistent interfaces
for counting and reporting floating point operations performed in the
Epetra computational classes. All classes based on the
Epetra\_CompObject can count flops by the user creating an Epetra\_Flops
object and calling the SetFlopCounter() method for an
Epetra\_CompObject.

As an example, suppose you are interested in counting the flops required
by a vector-vector product (between, say, \verb!x! and \verb!y!).  The
first step is to create an instance of the class:
\begin{verbatim}
Epetra_Flops counter();
\end{verbatim}
Then, it is necessary to ``hook'' the counter object to the desired
computational object, in the following way:
\begin{verbatim}
x.SetFlopCounter(counter);
y.SetFlopCounter(counter);
\end{verbatim}
Then, we perform the desired computations on Epetra objects (in this
case, the vector-vector problem):
\begin{verbatim}
x.Dot(y,&dotProduct);
\end{verbatim}
Finally we can extract the number of performed operations ans stored it
in the double variable \verb!total_flops! as
\begin{verbatim}
total_flops = counter.Flops();
\end{verbatim}
which are the toal number of {\sl serial} flops. This will also reset
the flop counter.


Epetra\_Time objects can be used in conjunction with Epetra\_Flops
objects to estimate the number of floating point operations per second
of a given code (or a part of it). One can proceed as here reported:
\begin{verbatim}
Epetra_Flops counter;
x.SetFlopCounter(counter);
Epetra_Time timer(Comm);
x.Dot(y,&dotProduct);
double elapsed_time = timer.ElapsedTime();
double total_flops =counter.Flops();
cout << "Total ops: " << total_flops << endl;
double MFLOPs = total_flops/elapsed_time/1000000.0;
cout << "Total MFLOPs  for mat-vec = " << MFLOPs << endl<< endl;
\end{verbatim}
This code is reported in \TriExe{epetra/ex20.cpp}. The output will be
approximatively as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
[msala:epetra]> mpirun -np 2 ./ex20
Total ops: 734
Total MFLOPs  for mat-vec = 6.92688

Total ops: 734
Total MFLOPs  for mat-vec = 2.48021

Total ops: 246
Total MFLOPs for vec-vec = 0.500985

q dot z = 2
Total ops: 246
Total MFLOPs for vec-vec = 0.592825

q dot z = 2
\end{verbatim}

\begin{remark} Operation count are serial count, and therefore keep
  trace of local operations only.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  Each computational class has a \verb!Flops()! method, that can queried
  for the flop count of that object.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Epetra\_Operator and Epetra\_RowMatrix Classes}
\label{sec:operator}

Matrix-free methods can be easily introduced in the Epetra framework
using one of the following two classes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Epetra\_Operator;
\item Epetra\_RowMatrix.
\end{itemize}
Technically, both classes are pure virtual classes (that is, they
specify interfaces only), that enable the use of real-valued
double-precision sparse matrices. Epetra\_RowMatrix, derived from
Epetra\_Operator, is meant for matrices where the matrix entries are
intended for row access, and it is currently implemented by
Epetra\_CrsMatrix, Epetra\_VbrMatrix, Epetra\_FECrsMatrix, and
Epetra\_FEVbrMatrix.

In the following, we consider for instance how to apply a matrix to a
vector without explicitly constructing the matrix. The matrix is the
classical finite-difference discretization of a Laplace on a 1D grid
with constant grid-size. For the sake of simplicity, we avoid the issues
related to intra-process communication (hence this code can be run with
one process only). 

The first step is the definition of a class, here called
\verb!TriDiagonalOperator!, and derived from the Epetra\_Operator class.
\begin{verbatim}
class TriDiagonalOperator : public Epetra_Operator {
public:
 // .. definitions here, constructors and methods
private:
  Epetra_Map Map_;
  double diag_minus_one_;   // value in the sub-diagonal
  double diag_;             // value in the diagonal
  double diag_plus_one_;    // value in the super-diagonal
}
\end{verbatim}
As the class  Epetra\_Operator implements several virtual methods, we
have to specify all those methods in our class. Among them, we are
interested in the \verb!Apply! method, which may be coded as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
int Apply( const Epetra_MultiVector & X, Epetra_MultiVector & Y ) const {
  int Length = X.MyLength();
  
  // need to handle multi-vectors and not only vectors
  for( int vec=0 ; vec<X.NumVectors() ; ++vec ) {
    
    // one-dimensional problems here
    if( Length == 1 ) {
      Y[vec][0] = diag_ * X[vec][0];
      break;
    }
    
    // more general case (Lenght >= 2)
    // first row
    Y[vec][0] = diag_ * X[vec][0] + diag_plus_one_ * X[vec][1];
    
    // intermediate rows
    for( int i=1 ; i<Length-1 ; ++i ) {
      Y[vec][i] = diag_ * X[vec][i] + diag_plus_one_ * X[vec][i+1]
        + diag_minus_one_ * X[vec][i-1];
    }
    // final row
    Y[vec][Length-1] = diag_ * X[vec][Length-1]
      + diag_minus_one_ * X[vec][Length-2];
  }
  return true;
}
\end{verbatim}
Now, in the \verb!main! function, we can define a TriDiagonalOperatr object
using the specified constructor:
\begin{verbatim}
  TriDiagonalOperator TriDiagOp(-1.0,2.0,-1.0,Map);
\end{verbatim}
and we can apply this operator to a vector as:
\begin{verbatim}
  DiagOp.Apply(x,y);
\end{verbatim}

\TriExe{epetra/ex21.cpp} reportes the entire source code.

\begin{remark}
  The clear disadvantage of deriving Epetra\_Operator or
  Epetra\_RowMatrix with respect to use Epetra\_CrsMatrix or
  Epetra\_VbrMatrix, is that users must specify their communication
  patterns for intra-process data exchange. For this purpose,
  Epetra\_Import classes can be used.  File \TriExe{epetra/ex22.cpp}
  shows how to extend \verb!ex21.cpp! to the multi-process case. This
  example makes use of the Epetra\_Import class to exchange data.
\end{remark}

%%%
%%%
%%%

Another use of  Epetra\_Operator and Epetra\_RowMatrix is to allow
support for user's defined matrix format. For instance, suppose that
your code generates matrices in MSR format (detailed in the Aztec
documentation). You can easily create an Epetra\_Operator, that applies
the MSR format to Epetra\_MultiVectors. For the sake of simplicity, we
will limit ourselves to the monoprocess case. Extentions to
multi-processes case requires to handle ghost-nodes updates.

As a first step, we create a class, derived from the Epetra\_Operator
class,
\begin{verbatim}
class MSRMatrix : public Epetra_Operator 
{

public:
  // constructor
  MSRMatrix(Epetra_Map Map, int * bindx, double * val) :
    Map_(Map), bindx_(bindx), val_(val) 
  {}

  ~MSRMatrix() // destructor
  {}

  // Apply the RowMatrix to a MultiVector
  int Apply(const Epetra_MultiVector & X, Epetra_MultiVector & Y ) const 
  {

    int Nrows = bindx_[0]-1;
    
    for( int i=0 ; i<Nrows ; i++ ) {
      // diagonal element
      for( int vec=0 ; vec<X.NumVectors() ; ++vec ) {
        Y[vec][i] = val_[i]*X[vec][i];
      }
      // off-diagonal elements
      for( int j=bindx_[i] ; j<bindx_[i+1] ; j++ ) {
        for( int vec=0 ; vec<X.NumVectors() ; ++vec ) {
          Y[vec][bindx_[j]] += val_[j]*X[vec][bindx_[j]];
        }
      }
    }
    return 0;
  } /* Apply */
  ... other functions ...

private:
  int * bindx_; double * val_;
}
\end{verbatim}
As stated by the fragment of code above, the constructor take the two
MSR vectors, and an Epetra\_Map. The complete code is reported in
\TriExe{epetra/ex25.cpp}.

\subsection{Epetra\_LinearProblem}
\label{sec:linear_problem}

A linear problem of type $A X = B$ is defined by an
Epetra\_LinearProblem class. This class required an Epetra\_RowMatrix or
an Epetra\_Operator object (often an Epetra\_CrsMatrix or
Epetra\_VbrMatrix), and two (multi-)vectors $X$ and $B$. $X$ must have
been defined using a map equivalent to the DomainMap of $A$, while $B$
using a map equivalent ot the RangeMap of $A$ (see
Section~\ref{sec:sparse_mat}).

Linear problems can be used to solve linear systems with iterative
methods (typically, using AztecOO, covered in
Chapter~\ref{chap:aztecoo}), or with direct solvers (typically, using
Amesos, described in Chapter~\ref{chap:amesos}. 

Once the linear problem has been defined, the user can:

\begin{itemize}
\item scale the problem, using \verb!LeftScale(D)! or
  \verb!RightScale(D)!, \verb!D! being an Epetra\_Vector of compatible
  size;
%\item define a preconditioner for the iterative solution;
\item change $X$ and $B$, using \verb!SetRHS(&B)! and \verb!SetLHS(&X)!;
\item change $A$, using \verb!SetOperator(&A)!.
\end{itemize}
