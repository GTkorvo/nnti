\section{Partitioning and Load Balancing using Zoltan}
\label{chap:zoltan}

In order to get good parallel performance, the data 
distribution (layout) is important. Poor data distribution can both
cause high communication between processes and also load imbalance,
that is, some processes have more work than others. 

The Zoltan library \cite{ZoltanUG} was developed at Sandia to assist
scientific computing applications with load balancing and parallel
data management. Zoltan is not a Trilinos package, and must be
obtained separately. The Trilinos package EpetraExt provides
an interface between Epetra and Zoltan, which is described in
this chapter. Note that Zoltan may be used independently of Epetra
or Trilinos. Zoltan contains a collection of load-balancing algorithms 
with a single, data-structure neutral interface.

\subsection{Background}
In parallel linear algebra applications, the most critical part is to 
distribute the matrices. The vectors are often distributed to conform
with the appropriate matrices, though not always. Matrices can
be partitioned either along rows, columns, or by a 2-dimensional
block decomposition. We limit our discussion to 1-dimensional data
distributions (which are supported in Epetra). In this case, 
partitioning dense matrices is easy.
For a matrix with $n$ rows and with $p$ processes, simply give
each process $n/p$  rows. For sparse matrices, the situation
is more complicated. To achieve load-balance, one may wish 
that each process obtains approximately the same number of rows,
or alternatively, similar number of nonzero entries. 
Additionally, the communication cost when applying the matrix
should be small. Specifically, for iterative solvers, the
communication cost in a matrix-vector product should be minimized.

A common abstraction of this problem is \emph{graph partitioning}.
This model assumes the matrix is symmetric, so the sparsity 
pattern of the matrix can be represented by an undirected graph.
The graph partitioning problem is to partition the
vertices into $p$ sets such that the number of edges between
sets are minimized. The number of cut edges approximates the
communication cost in the parallel computation. Although 
graph partitioning is NP-hard to solve exactly, there are
several fast algorithms that work well in practice. Zoltan
provides a common interface to graph partitioners (and other algorithms).
At present, the most widely used software for graph partitioning,
are the METIS and ParMETIS \cite{} packages from University of Minnesota.

In recent years, it has been shown \cite{Aykanat} that hypergraph partitioning 
is a more accurate model for parallel matrix-vector communication cost.
Work is currently underway to provide such advanced partitioning capability
in future versions of Zoltan and EpetraExt. Hypergraph partitioning
also applies to rectangular matrices.

\subsection{Installing Zoltan and Configuration}
Zoltaan is not a Trilinos package and must be obtained separately.
Zoltan is freely available under the LGPL license, and can
be obtained from the Zoltan home page at 
\texttt{http://www.cs.sandia.gov/Zoltan}. (If you have access
to the Trilinos developers cvs repository, you may also  
get Zoltan from the Trilinos3PL module.)
Zoltan versions 1.5x are compatible with Trilinos 4.0. 

We suggest that you install Zoltan together with other 3rd party software 
for Trilinos. It is helpful to define a shell variable \verb!TRILINOS_3PL! 
for this location, see section \ref{sec:3pl} for details. After 
you download Zoltan, you must uncompress and untar the
\verb!Zoltan.tar.gz! file and then follow the instructions. 
Zoltan has not been autotool'ed so you must manually configure
Zoltan to your machine. (Sample configuration files for common
platforms are included in the \verb!Utilities/Config! directory.) 

Before you compile Zoltan, you need to know if you have the ParMetis 
library installed.
If you don't have it already, there should be a copy bundled
with Zoltan. It is also possible that you got ParMetis with
the ML package in Trilinos. If you can't find it anywhere, 
download ParMetis from \texttt{http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~karypis/metis/parmetis}. Version 3.1 is recommended, though other versions will work, too.
It is a good idea to put the ParMetis library in the \verb!TRILINOS_3PL!
as well. You should not build more than one version of ParMetis; multiple versions may cause problems. After building ParMetis, you need to put
the correct path (for your system) in the relevant Zoltan configuration file
in the \verb!Utilities/Config! directory. Then you can finally make Zoltan
by typing \verb!make zoltan!. (See the Zoltan documentation for more details.)

After you have built Zoltan, copy the \verb!libzoltan.a! file over to
your \verb!TRILINOS_3PL/LINUX_MPI/lib! directory. You also
need to copy the header files in the Zoltan \verb!include! directory
to \verb!TRILINOS_3PL/LINUX_MPI/include!. 
Alternatively, leave the header files where they are and add this
directory to the include path in the Trilinos configure.

Next you need to configure Trilinos to use EpetraExt with Zoltan.
You do this with a command of the type
\begin{verbatim}
./configure --prefix=${TRILINOS_HOME}/LINUX_MPI \
--enable-mpi --with-mpi-compilers \
--enable-epetraext-zoltan \
--with-trilinos3pldir=${TRILINOS_3PL} \
--with-ldflags="-L${TRILINOS_3PL}/LINUX_MPI/lib" \
--with-incdirs="-I${TRILINOS_3PL}/LINUX_MPI/include"
\end{verbatim}

Then type \verb!make! and \verb!make install! as usual.

\section{Load-balancing with Zoltan via EpetraExt}

TO COME:
Simple example using Zoltan\_CrsGraph. 
Second example using Transforms.


\subsection{Load-balancing with Zoltan in other ways}

Many applications use Zoltan for load-balancing directly, without
going through EpetraExt. This allows a full choice of algorithms
and options, while the EpetraExt interface only supports
Zoltan with ParMetis graph partitioning. Zoltan is written in ANSI C,
and a light-weight C++ interface will be included in future Zoltan
releases.  There is a fairly sophisticated
C++ interface to Zoltan in EpetraExt. The relevant classes
are \verb!Zoltan::LoadBalance!, \verb!Zoltan::QueryObject!,
and \verb!Zoltan::MigrationObject!.
