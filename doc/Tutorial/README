This directory contains the example files used in the Trilinos Tutorial.
Details on the installation are reported in this document. Please
note that the environment variable
TRILINOS_HOME
TRILINOS_ARCH
TRILINOS_LIB
must have been defined. (This is not required by Trilinos, nor strictly
necessary. You could avoid those definitions; however, in this case you
will have to modify the Makefiles contained in each subdirectory.)

Tutorial files have not been autotool'd.

The subdirectory `latex' contains the source files of the tutorial.
