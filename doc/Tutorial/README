This directory contains the example files used in the Trilinos Tutorial.
Details on the installation are reported in this document. Please
note that the environment variable
  TRILINOS_HOME
  TRILINOS_ARCH
  TRILINOS_LIB
must have been defined. (This is not required by Trilinos, nor strictly
necessary. You could avoid those definitions; however, in this case you
will have to modify the Makefiles contained in each subdirectory.)


Tutorial files have not been autotool'd. 


The subdirectory `latex' contains the source files of the tutorial.


IMPORTANT NOTE:
==============

It is almost impossible to prepare Makefile's for all the installations.
The exact linker line depends on how Trilinos has been configured, 
compiled, and installed on a given machine. Packages like Amesos and ML will
require different linking options. The user is likely to be required to
modify Makefile.in to fix linking problems.
