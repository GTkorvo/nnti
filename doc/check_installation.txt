This file explains a possible way to check the Trilinos installation.

After you have configured and compiled Trilinos (that is, typed "make"), you 
can execute most of the compiled examples by typing:

$ make run-examples                                                  (1)

At present, this command is supported by the following packages:
Epetra, EpetraExt, AztecOO, IFPACK, Amesos, and ML. Note that command (1)
will *not* compile any example, therefore if you have configured Trilinos
with --disable-examples, nothing will be run. 

If you have configured Trilinos with MPI support, you might need to initialize
the MPI deamon (for example, LAM/MPI requires a call to lamboot). By default,
Trilinos supposed that an MPI executable is ran using

$ mpirun -np <num-procs> <executable-name>

If no, you can specify the command to be used instead of "mpirun -np "
by setting the environmental variable TRILINOS_MPI_GO. For example, some DEC
machines require the following (using BASH):

$ export TRILINOS_MPI_GO="prun -n "

Command (1) should run relatively fast. If you want a more accurate test,
simply type

$ make run-tests                                                     (2)

Command (2) will run most of the test harness suite of Trilinos, and might
take some time.

If you have configured Trilinos with Python support, you can also try

$ make run-pyexamples                                                 (3)

Command (3) will check the Python modules of Trilinos. This command requires:
- you have already installed Trilinos by typing "make install"
- you have already set the envirnomental variable PYTHONPATH, so that
  Python can find the PyTrilinos module.
