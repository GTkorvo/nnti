%CSE software projects share many of the goals common to all software projects, but also require some additional goals.  Of course, the primary goal of all software projects is quality--quality both in the colloquial meaning of the word and the particular meaning it carries in the software engineering world, specifically:  a measure of the degree to which software meets its stated requirements.
                                                                                
%It is important that a CSE software project maintain a certain level of modularity.  CSE software functionality is often developed by small expert teams, and often there are even a number of small teams or individuals working on different functionality with a project.  Keeping logically distinct pieces of functionality modular is critical to the longterm health of a project.

%For many CSE software projects it simply isn't feasible to have a traditional, formal development model.

Developing computational science and engineering (CSE) software presents some unique challenges.  CSE software projects frequently don't have large budgets to spend on advanced software engineering tools, processes, and personnel.  They often are developed by small groups of experts--experts in the particular computational science or engineering domain in question, not experts on software engineering or software project management.  It is our belief that there are certain low-cost, high-yield processes and tools that tend to work well to enable the development of high quality CSE software.  To demonstrate this, we will first outline a number of very high-level goals for CSE software projects.  We will then present a development model that we think does a good job of enabling developers to reach those ends.  Finally, we will discuss some general classes of tools that enable that development model, and through that, the ultimate goals of the project.  Throughout we will use our experiences on the Trilinos project to provide specific examples of these tools and processes.
