\begin{itemize}
\item[Trilinos]
The name of the project.  Also a Greek term which,
loosely translated means ``a string of pearls,'' 
meant to evoke an image that each Trilinos package is a pearl in its 
own right, but is even more valuable when combined with other 
packages.

\item[Package]
A self-contained collection of software in Trilinos
focused on one primary class of numerical
methods.  Also a fundamental, integral unit in the Trilinos framework.

\item[new\_package] A sample Trilinos package containing all of the
infrastructure to install a new package into the Trilinos framework.
Contains the basic directory structure, a collection of sample
configuration and build files and a sample ``Hello World'' package.
Also a website.

\item[Anasazi]
An extensible and interoperable framework for large-scale eigenvalue
algorithms.The motivation for this framework is to provide a generic
interface to a collection of algorithms for solving large-scale 
eigenvalue problems.

\item[AztecOO] 
Linear solver package based on preconditioned Krylov methods.  A 
follow-on to the Aztec solver package~\cite{Aztec2.1}.  
Supports all Aztec 
interfaces and functionality, but also provides significant new 
functionality.

\item[Belos] A Greek term meaning ``arrow.'' Belos is the next
generation of iterative solvers.  Belos solvers are written using
``generic'' programming techniques.  In other words, Belos is written
using TSF abstract interfaces and therefore has no explicit dependence
on any concrete linear algebra library.  Instead, Belos solvers can be
used with any concrete linear algebra library that implements the TSF
abstract interfaces. 

\item[Ifpack] 
Object-oriented algebraic preconditioner, compatible with 
Epetra and AztecOO.  Supports construction and use of parallel
distributed memory preconditioners such as overlapping Schwarz domain
decomposition, Jacobi scaling and local Gauss-Seidel relaxations.

\item[Komplex] 
Complex linear equation solver using equivalent real 
formulations~\cite{DayHero2000}, built on top of Epetra and AztecOO.

\item[LOCA]
Library of continuation algorithms. A package of scalable stability 
analysis algorithms (available as part of 
the NOX nonlinear solver package). When integrated into an application code, 
LOCA enables the tracking of solution branches as a function of system 
parameters and the direct tracking of bifurcation points.

\item[Meros]
Segregated preconditioning package.  Provides scalable block
preconditioning for problems that couple simultaneous solution
variables such as Navier-Stokes problems. 

\item[ML]
Algebraic multi-level preconditioner package.  Provides scalable
preconditioning capabilities for a variety of problem classes.  

\item[NOX]
A collection of nonlinear solvers, designed to be easily integrated
into an application and used with many different linear solvers.

\item[Petra]
A Greek term meaning ``foundation.''  Trilinos has three Petra 
libraries: Epetra, Tpetra and Jpetra that provide basic classes 
for constructing and manipulating matrix, graph and vector
objects.  Epetra is the current production version that is
split into two packages, one core and one extensions.

\begin{itemize}

\item[Epetra] Current C++ production implementation of the Petra
Object Model.  The ``E'' in Epetra stands for ``essential'' implying
that this version provides the most important capabilities that are
commonly needed by our target application base.  Epetra supports real,
double-precision floating point data only (no single-precision or
complex).  Epetra avoids explicit use of some of the more
advanced features of C++, including templates and the Standard
Template Library, that can be impediments to portability.

\item[Tpetra] The future C++ version of Petra, using templates and
other more advanced features of C++.  Tpetra supports arbitrary scalar
and ordinal types, and makes extensive use of advanced C++ features.

\item[Jpetra] A Java implementation of Petra, supporting real,
double-precision data.  Written in pure Java, it is designed to be
byte-code portable and can be executed across multiple compute nodes.

\end{itemize}

\item[Teuchos] A collection of classes and service software that is
useful to almost almost all Trilinos packages.  Includes
reference-counted pointers, parameter lists, templated interfaces to
BLAS, LAPACK and traits for templates.  

\item[TSF] A collection of abstract interfaces that supports application
access to a variety of Trilinos capabilities, supports
interoperability betweeen Trilinos packages and provides future extensibility.
TSF is composed of several packages.  The primary user packages are:  
\begin{itemize}

\item[TSFCore] TSFCore provides 
a basic collection of abstract interfaces to vectors, linear
operators, solvers, etc.  These interfaces provide a common
interface for applications to access one or more packages that
implement the abstract interface.  These interfaces can also be used
by other packages in Trilinos to accomplish the same purpose.

\item[TSFExtended] TSFExtended builds on top of TSFCore, providing implicit
aggregation capabilities and overloaded operators.
