% If you want to relax some of the SAND98-0730 requirements, use the "relax"
% option. It adds spaces and boldface in the table of contents, and does not
% force the page layout sizes.
% e.g. \documentclass[relax,12pt]{SANDreport}
%
% You can also use the "strict" option, which applies even more of the
% SAND98-0730 guidelines. It gets rid of section numbers which are often
% useful; e.g. \documentclass[strict]{SANDreport}

\begin{abstract}
%
Engineering and scientific applications are becoming increasingly
modular, utilizing publicly defined interfaces to integrate
third party tools and libraries for services such as
mesh generation, data partitioning, equation solvers and optimization.
As a result, it is important to understand and model the interaction between 
these various modules, and to develop good abstract interfaces between
the primary modules.  One category of modules that is becoming
increasingly important is abstract numerical algorithms (ANAs).  ANAs
such as linear and nonlinear equation solvers,
methods for stability and bifurcation analysis,
uncertainty quantification methods and nonlinear programming solvers
for optimization are typically mathematically 
sophisticated but have surprisingly little essential dependence on the
details of what computer system is being used or how matrices and
vectors are stored and computed.  As a result, using abstract
interface capabilities in languages such as C++, we can implement ANA
software such that it will work, unchanged, with a variety of
applications and linear algebra libraries.

In this paper we present a package of minimal but complete (with
respect to basic required functionality and performance)
object-oriented interfaces (implemented in C++) called TSFCore, which
allows the development many of these ANAs and simplifies the
development of interfaces to applications and linear algebra
libraries.

%\section{Summary}
%Once a certain level of mistrust and scepticism has
%been overcome, magic finds many uses in todays science
%and engineering. In this report we explain some of the
%fundamental spells and instruments of magic and wizardry. We
%then conclude with a few examples on how they can be used
%in daily activities at national Laboratories.
