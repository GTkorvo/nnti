    \begin{abstract}

Research efforts in advanced solution algorithms and parallel solver
libraries have historically had a large impact on engineering and
scientific computing.  Algorithmic advances increase the range
of tractable problems and reduce the cost of solving existing
problems.  Well-designed solver libraries provide a mechanism for
leveraging solver development across a broad set of applications and
minimize the cost of solver integration.  Emphasis is
required in both new algorithms and new software in order
to achieve the maximum impact of efforts.

The Trilinos project encompasses a variety of efforts that are to some
extent self-contained but at the same time inter-related.  The
Trilinos design allows individual packages to grow and mature
autonomously to the extent the algorithms and package developers
dictate. 

The Trilinos Developer's Guide is meant to assist existing, as well as new and
potential Trilinos developers.  Topics covered include how to configure and 
build Trilinos, what is required to integrate an existing package into Trilinos
and examples of how those requirements can be met, as well as what tools are 
available to Trilinos packages.  Also discussed are some common practices that 
are followed by many Trilinos package developers.  Finally, a graphical depiction of 
Trilinos package iteroperability is supplied along with a list of platforms 
that Trilinos has been ported to.

	\subsection{Briew Overview}
	\begin{quote}
The Trilinos Project is an effort to develop parallel solver algorithms and 
libraries within 
an object-oriented software framework for the solution of large-scale, complex
multi-physics engineering and scientific applications.   Our emphasis is on 
developing robust, scalable algorithms in a software framework, using abstract 
interfaces for flexible interoperability of components and providing a 
full-featured set of concrete classes that implement all abstract interfaces. 
Trilinos components are primarily written in C++, but provide essential C and 
Fortran user interface support.  We provide an open architecture that allows 
easy integration with other solver packages and we deliver our software to 
the outside community via the Gnu Lesser General Public License
(LGPL)~\cite{gnu-license-site}.

	\subsection{What is Covered in this Guide}
**(see lines 230-243)

The Trilinos Developer's Guide is meant to assist existing, as well as new and
potential Trilinos developers.  Topics covered include how to configure and 
build Trilinos, what is required to integrate an existing package into Trilinos
and examples of how those requirements can be met, as well as what tools are 
available to Trilinos packages.  Also discussed are some common practices that 
are followed by many Trilinos package developers; these are found in the 
chapter entitled ``Suggested practices''.  Finally, a graphical depiction of 
Trilinos package iteroperability is supplied along with a list of platforms 
that Trilinos has been ported to.

\section{Package Requirements}
	**(Req's and how to satisfy them - break into subsections)**

Stages of integration:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Put the package in the Trilinos repository.
\item Package should respond to all relevant configure options.
\item Package should have a process in place to port to all supported platforms and respond to bug
reports in timely manner.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Suggested Practices}
	**(suggested coding guidelines, and other non-manditory practices that are encouraged - break up.  See Overview Doc pg 11,14-15.)**

There are many ways to define an effective software process.  As a result, the Trilinos project
specifies very few {\it requirements}.  At the same time, many software packages do not have
well-defined practices to support good software engineering.  In this section, we discuss
suggested practices based on our experience with some common tools and process for software
engineering.  We want to strongly emphasize that these are {\it suggested} practices only and we
discuss them here in order to facilitate adoption of practices for packages that have few existing
practices in place.

\subsection{Preliminary Steps}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Set up necessary accounts on software.sandia.gov.
\item Establish Bugzilla Product and Component Definitions.
Discussion of how to define bugzilla pieces.  Should discuss common component definitions.  List
Heroux or Kolda or Sery as contacts.
\item Establish Email Lists
\item Others?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Practices to Support Software Lifecycle}

One common view of software engineering processes breaks the process down into seven phases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Requirements.
\item Specification.
\item Design.
\item Implementation.
\item Integration.
\item Maintenance.
\item Retirement/Replacement.
\end{enumerate}
In this section we discuss suggested practices to address most of these phases.  The value of 
adopting these practices is that they are commonly used or planned for use in a number of existing
Trilinos packages.  It is worth noting that testing is not a phase, but should be done at each of
the above phases in the process as appropriate for that phase.

\subsection{Requirements}
The majority of requirements for Trilinos packages come either directly or indirectly from funded
research proposals and plans.  Although these requirements are sometimes difficult to elicit from
the proposals and plans, we assume that a package is satisfying requirements by virtue of being
funded.  Therefore we only suggest that package developers track their requirements as part of the
communication with funding sponsors.

\subsection{Specification/Design}
Package specifications can be done in many ways.  An effective way for object-oriented, e.g., C++
packages is to use documented header files and a documentation tool such as Doxygen~\cite{doxyen},
and then communicate the generated HTML output to the package development team via the {\it
package-developers@software.sandia.gov} email list.  This both

\subsection{Implementation}
Nothing suggested.

\subsection{Integration}
Mention Epetra/TSF. Autotools.

\subsection{Maintenance}
Say something about bugzilla, bonzai, mailman (checkins list), CVS (release branches) the test harness.

\subsection{Retirement/Replacement}
To the extent possible checkins to a release branch should not force interface changes for users.
Even on the development branch, users should be notified (via the package-users mail list) that
checkins are about to happen that would require an interface change to user code.

In general, we will be very slow to omit a package, or version of a package, that is in use unless
there is equivalent interface and functionality support from a new package.

	\section{Services Available to Trilinos Packages}
	A number of services exist for Trilinos packages.
	\subsection{Configuration Management}
	**(See Overview Doc pg 12)**
Autoconf~\cite{Autoconf},  Automake~\cite{Automake} and
Libtool~\cite{Libtool} provide a robust, full-featured set of tools for
building software across a broad set of platforms (see also the ``Goat
Book''~\cite{GoatBook}).  Although these
tools are not official standards, they are commonly used in many
packages.  Many existing
Trilinos packages use Autoconf and Automake (and will use
Libtool in the future).  However, use of these tools is not required.

Package developers who are not currently using autotools, but would like
to, can get a jump start by using a Trilinos package called 
``new\_package''.  This trivial package exists for one primary purpose.  
It walks a developer through the process of setting up a package to 
configure and build using autotools.  General instructions for how to get 
started can be found in Trilinos/packages/new\_package/README.  Please note 
that new\_package is a work in progess, suggestions and contributions are 
welcome, especially for FAQ's.

Trilinos provides a set of M4~\cite{M4} macros that can be used by any other
package that wants to use Autoconf and Automake for configuring and
building libraries.  These macros perform common configuration tasks such as
locating a valid LAPACK~\cite{lapack} library, or checking for a user-
defined MPI C compiler.  The macros can be found in the Trilinos CVS 
repository in Trilinos/config.  These macros minimize the amount of redudant
 effort in using Autotools, and make it easier to apply a general change to 
the configure process for all packages.
	\subsection{Regression Testing}
Trilinos provides a variety of regression
testing capabilities.  Within a number of Trilinos packages, we employ
``white box'' testing where detailed information about the software is
used and probed.  In addition, Trilinos performs ``black box'' testing
of packages via the Trilinos Solver Framework (TSF) virtual class
interfaces.  Any package that implements the TSF interfaces (see
Section~\ref{subsect:InteropTSF} below **(MAKE SURE BELOW, NOTE ABOVE)), can be tested via this black box
test environment.  ({\bf NOTE: Black box testing via TSF is not in
place at this time}
	\subsection{Periodic Testing}
Trilinos Packages that configure and build using Autotools can easily 
utilize the the Trilinos testharness.  The testharness performs a CVS update
(gets the most recent source code) every night and then builds the libraries
and runs any tests that have been integrated into the testharness.  
Currently the testharness only runs on a Linux platform, but it will 
eventually run on 5-8 platforms.  Packages that have not ported to a 
particular platform can be excluded from the testing process on that 
platform.  Packages that do not have any tests integrated into the 
testharness can still benefit by ensuring that libraries build without 
errors.  Integrating existing tests into the testharness is not difficult.  
The process is discussed in Trilinos/testharness/HowToAddToTestHarness.  
Please note that this document is a work in progress.

\subsection{CVS Repository}
Trilinos source code is maintained in a CVS~\cite{CVS} repository.  It is 
very easy to add new packages to the repository.  Packages that already use 
CVS can even rettain their CVS history!  To access the repository, one must 
have an account on software.sandia.gov.  Once an account has been granted, 
set the following two environment variables (replace ``your\_user\_name'' 
with your user name on software):

\begin{verbatim}
CVSROOT :ext:your\_user\_name@software.sandia.gov:/space/CVS
CVS\_RSH ssh
\end{verbatim}

For those not familiar with CVS, below is a brief discussion covering some 
of the most common CVS commands.  For more information, see the Gnu CVS Home
Page~\cite{CVS}.

Checking Out a Working Copy

To get started, checkout a copy of the development branch of the repository.
(Releases branches can be obtained by by checking out the appropriate 
tagged version of the repository.)

\begin{verbatim}
cvs checkout Trilinos
\end{verbatim}

Updating a Woring Copy
To update after a version has been obtained use the ``update'' command.  
First, cd to the directory that is to be updated (usually the Trilinos root 
directory).  Then type:

\begin{verbatim}
cvs -q update -dP
\end{verbatim}

The ``-q'' option means ``be somewhat quiet''.  Try the command without this
option to see what it does.  

The ``-d'' option means to get any new directories.  For example, if a new 
package is added to the repository, but the ``-d'' option is not used, that 
new package will never appear in the working copy.  However, the first time 
that the ``-d'' option is used, all of the new package directories will be 
downloaded, and from that time on, all CVS updates will update the 
directories that were downloaded.  It is good practice to include this 
option for every CVS update.

... Decide if this subsection is worth it, or if people should read the doc.  If eexpanded, add info about when to check in, and which branch...

\subsection{Bonsai}
A lot of useful information related to CVS history is accessible via a
web-based interface package called Bonsai~\cite{Bonsai}.  This tool can be 
found on the web at ``http://software.sandia.gov/bonsai''.  Bonsai gives a 
developer the ability to view the changes made to the files in the 
repository.  The tool can be especially useful when trying to figure out which 
changes may have introduced bugs into a piece of code.  Developers can search 
for changes based on filename, directory, branch, date, user who made the 
change, or any combination of these criteria.  The entire revision histories of
individual files returned in a search can be utilized in finding the source of 
bugs.  The differences between any two versions of a file may be viewed.  

\subsection{Bugzilla}

Features and bug reports are tracked using Bugzilla~\cite{Bugzilla}.  Bugzilla 
can be found on the web at ``http://software.sandia.gov/bugzilla''.  A 
Bugzilla account is necessary for submitting bugs.  Those interested can sign 
up at the website.  All bugs related to any package of Trilnos that uses 
Bugzilla should be submitted to Bugzilla.  This even applies to cases in which 
one developer diagnoses and fixes a bug within a short period of time.  A bug 
report is still very valuable in this case because it provides an artifact 
that outlines the problem and explains how the problem was fixed.  A bug 
report should be filled out with as much detail as possible.  Likewise, after 
a bug has been resolved, the developer should also provide a detailed 
description of the solution that was used.

**explain how this is truly useful, and not just busy work.**

NOTE: In the context of Bugzilla, ``bug'' can refer not only to an error in 
existing code, but also to a desired enhancement.  For example, a bug report 
should be submitted to Bugzilla to report a segmentation fault that occurs 
when using an existing Ifpack preconditioner, and a bug report should also be
submitted to request a new Ifpack preconditioner.

\subsection{Mailman}

Email lists are maintained for Trilinos as a whole and for each package 
through Mailman~\cite{Mailman}.  This tool can be found on the web at 
``http://software.sandia.gov/mailman/listinfo''.  Those interested in signing 
up for one or more lists may do so at the website.  Non-Sandians are able to 
sign up for the ``Users'' and ``Announce'' lists.  Sandians should keep this 
in mind when posting to these lists.

Lists for new packages can be set up very easily.  Each package usually has 
five mailing lists.  The example mailing lists mentioned below are to be used 
for issues relating to all of Trilinos.  The names for the lists pertaining to 
individual packages follow the same naming scheme, simply replace ``Trilinos'' 
with the name of the package.  For example the list for Trilnos users is 
called Trilinos-Users and the email address is 
\begin{verbatim}trilinos-users@software.sandia.gov\end{verbatim}.  The list 
for Epetra users is called Epetra-Users and the associated email address is 
\begin{verbatim}epetra-users@software.sandia.gov\end{verbatim}.

TIP: While those who use Epetra (or any other Trilinos package) are also
``Trilinos users'', the lists are not set up to recognize this.  In other 
words, those who subscribe to the Epetra-Users mailing list do not necessarily 
form a subset of those who subscribe to the Trilinos-Users mailing list.  This 
is also true of all other list types.  Keep this in mind when subscribing and 
posting to lists.
\begin{itemize}
\item Trilinos-Announce 
\begin{verbatim}trilinos-announce@software.sandia.gov\end{verbatim}

All Trilinos release announcements and other major news.

\item Trilinos-Checkins 
\begin{verbatim}trilinos-checkins@software.sandia.gov\end{verbatim}

CVS commit log messages that are releated to Trilinos in general or packages 
that have not had separate lists established.

\item Trilinos-Developers 
\begin{verbatim}trilinos-developers@software.sandia.gov\end{verbatim}

All discussions releated to Trilinos-specific development (not specific to a 
Trilinos package) are conducted via this list.  Important development 
decisions that originate in other places (regular email, discussions, etc) 
should also be posted to this list (or to the appropriate package list).  
By doing this, the list archive can provide a record explaining why various 
changes were made over time.

\item Trilinos-regression 
\begin{verbatim}trilinos-regression@software.sandia.gov\end{verbatim}

All regression test output that is not specific to a package. 

\item Trilinos-Users 
\begin{verbatim}trilinos-users@software.sandia.gov\end{verbatim}

List for Trilinos Users.  General discussions about the use of Trilinos.

\item Trilinos-Leaders
\begin{verbatim}trilinos-leaders@software.sandia.gov\end{verbatim}

Mailing list for representatives for each Trilinos package.  There are no 
leaders lists for individual packages.
\end{itemize}

All 
tools are accessible from the main Trilinos website~\cite{Trilinos-home-page}.

	\subsection{Portable Interface to BLAS and LAPACK}
	**(See Overview Doc pg 12)**

Portable interface to BLAS and LAPACK: The Basic Linear Algebra
Subprograms (BLAS)~\cite{BLAS1,BLAS2,BLAS3} and LAPACK~\cite{lapack}
provide a large repository of robust, high-performance mathematical
software for serial and shared memory parallel dense linear algebra
computations.  However, the BLAS and LAPACK interfaces are Fortran
specifications, and the mechanism for calling Fortran interfaces from
C and C++ varies across computing platforms.  Epetra (and Tpetra)
provide a set of simple, portable interfaces to the BLAS and LAPACK
that provide uniform access to the BLAS and LAPACK across a broad
set of platforms.  These interfaces are accessible to
other packages.

\subsection{Trilinos Configuration Options}

The following options apply to all Trilinos packages unless 
the option doesn't make sense for a particular package (for example, a 
package that does not include any Fortran code will not be sensitive to 
F77=g77), or otherwise noted.  NOTE: This list is not yet complete, in 
particular many options that apply to only a subset of Trilinos packages 
are not included.  For options specific to individual package, 'cd' to the 
home directory of the source code of the individual package and type 
``configure --help'' (without quotes).

Basic Options

\begin{itemize}
\item --enable-debug 

(Nox only.)  This turns on compiler debugger flags. It has 
not been fully tested. As an alternate, specify CXXFLAGS on the 
                 configure line.

\item --enable-opt

(Nox only.)  This turns on compiler optimization flags. It 
has not been fully tested. As an alternate, specify CXXFLAGS on the 
                 configure line. 

\item --with-cppflags 

Specify additional preprocessor flags (e.g., "-Dflag -Idir") 

\item --with-cxxflags 

Specify additional C++ flags 

\item --with-ldflags 

Specify additional linker flags (e.g., "-Ldir") 

\item --with-ar 

Specify a special archiver command, the default is "ar cru". 
\end{itemize}

 Influential Environmental Variables

\begin{itemize}
\item CC 

C compiler command.

\item CFLAGS 

C compiler flags.

\item CXX 

C++ compiler command.

\item CXXFLAGS 

C++ compiler flags.

\item LDFLAGS 

Specify linker flags.

\item CPPFLAGS 

C/C++ preprocessor flags.

\item CXXCPP 

C++ preprocessor.

\item F77 

Fortran 77 compiler command.

\item FFLAGS 

Fortran 77 compiler flags.
\end{itemize}

MPI-Related Options

\begin{itemize}
\item --enable-mpi 

Enables MPI mode. Defines HAVE\_MPI in the (Package)\_Config.h file. Will test 
for the ability to preprocess the MPI header file and may test ability to link 
with MPI.

\item --with-mpi-cxx 

If no argument is specified, uses "mpiCC". Otherwise, uses specified MPI C++
compiler. Automatically enables MPI mode. 

\item --with-mpi=MPIROOT 

Specify the MPI root directory. Automatically enables MPI mode. 

\item --with-mpi-libs="LIBS" 

Specify the MPI libraries. Defaults to "-lmpi" if either --with-mpi or 
--with-mpi-libdir is specified.

\item --with-mpi-incdir=DIR

Specify the MPI include files location. Defaults to MPIROOT/include if 
--with-mpi is specified. If multiple directories  must be specified, try 
--with-cppflags="-I<dir1> -I<dir2>" instead.

\item --with-mpi-libdir=DIR 

Specify the MPI libraries location. Defaults to MPIROOT/lib if --with-mpi 
is specified. If multiple directories must be specified, try 
--with-ldflags="-L<dir1> -L<dir2>" instead. 

Developer-Related Options

\item --enable-maintainer-mode 

Enable make rules and dependencies not useful (and sometimes confusing) to 
the casual installer.

\item Other important notes about the configure/build process.

\item Any code that links to Trilinos should define 'HAVE\_CONFIG\_H' (without
quotes).
