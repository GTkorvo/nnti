Brief Description (phrase): Develop preconditioner support for block entry
matrices in Ifpack.

Software Modification Request document (link to appropriate document):

Feasibility:
Very feasible.



Module(s) Impacted:

Epetra_CrsMatrix class:

Will add a constructor that takes an Epetra_RowMatrix.  This will allow VbrMatrix
objects (and any other class that implements the Epetra_Rowmatrix interface) to
have access to existing Ifpack CrsMatrix preconditioners.

Anticipate addition of classes for:
Block Jacobi preconditioning.
Block ILU.
Block SOR/SSOR.

Testing/Verification (with appropriate metrics):

Will add full coverage regression tests and example driers.
